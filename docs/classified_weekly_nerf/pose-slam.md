  - [A Real2Sim2Real Method for Robust Object Grasping with Neural Surface Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02685) | [code]
    > Recent 3D-based manipulation methods either directly predict the grasp pose using 3D neural networks, or solve the grasp pose using similar objects retrieved from shape databases. However, the former faces generalizability challenges when testing with new robot arms or unseen objects; and the latter assumes that similar objects exist in the databases. We hypothesize that recent 3D modeling methods provides a path towards building digital replica of the evaluation scene that affords physical simulation and supports robust manipulation algorithm learning. We propose to reconstruct high-quality meshes from real-world point clouds using state-of-the-art neural surface reconstruction method (the Real2Sim step). Because most simulators take meshes for fast simulation, the reconstructed meshes enable grasp pose labels generation without human efforts. The generated labels can train grasp network that performs robustly in the real evaluation scene (the Sim2Real step). In synthetic and real experiments, we show that the Real2Sim2Real pipeline performs better than baseline grasp networks trained with a large dataset and a grasp sampling method with retrieval-based reconstruction. The benefit of the Real2Sim2Real pipeline comes from 1) decoupling scene modeling and grasp sampling into sub-problems, and 2) both sub-problems can be solved with sufficiently high quality using recent 3D learning algorithms and mesh-based physical simulation techniques.
  - [Feature-Realistic Neural Fusion for Real-Time, Open Set Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03043) | [code]
    > General scene understanding for robotics requires flexible semantic representation, so that novel objects and structures which may not have been known at training time can be identified, segmented and grouped. We present an algorithm which fuses general learned features from a standard pre-trained network into a highly efficient 3D geometric neural field representation during real-time SLAM. The fused 3D feature maps inherit the coherence of the neural field's geometry representation. This means that tiny amounts of human labelling interacting at runtime enable objects or even parts of objects to be robustly and accurately segmented in an open set manner.
  - [IR-MCL: Implicit Representation-Based Online Global Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03113) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/PRBonn/ir-mcl)
    > Determining the state of a mobile robot is an essential building block of robot navigation systems. In this paper, we address the problem of estimating the robots pose in an indoor environment using 2D LiDAR data and investigate how modern environment models can improve gold standard Monte-Carlo localization (MCL) systems. We propose a neural occupancy field (NOF) to implicitly represent the scene using a neural network. With the pretrained network, we can synthesize 2D LiDAR scans for an arbitrary robot pose through volume rendering. Based on the implicit representation, we can obtain the similarity between a synthesized and actual scan as an observation model and integrate it into an MCL system to perform accurate localization. We evaluate our approach on five sequences of a self-recorded dataset and three publicly available datasets. We show that we can accurately and efficiently localize a robot using our approach surpassing the localization performance of state-of-the-art methods. The experiments suggest that the presented implicit representation is able to predict more accurate 2D LiDAR scans leading to an improved observation model for our particle filter-based localization. The code of our approach is released at: this https URL.
  - [NARF22: Neural Articulated Radiance Fields for Configuration-Aware Rendering, IROS2022](https://progress.eecs.umich.edu/projects/narf/) | [code]
    > Articulated objects pose a unique challenge for robotic perception and manipulation. Their increased number of degrees-of-freedom makes tasks such as localization computationally difficult, while also making the process of real-world dataset collection unscalable. With the aim of addressing these scalability issues, we propose Neural Articulated Radiance Fields (NARF22), a pipeline which uses a fully-differentiable, configuration-parameterized Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) as a means of providing high quality renderings of articulated objects. NARF22 requires no explicit knowledge of the object structure at inference time. We propose a two-stage parts-based training mechanism which allows the object rendering models to generalize well across the configuration space even if the underlying training data has as few as one configuration represented. We demonstrate the efficacy of NARF22 by training configurable renderers on a real-world articulated tool dataset collected via a Fetch mobile manipulation robot. We show the applicability of the model to gradient-based inference methods through a configuration estimation and 6 degree-of-freedom pose refinement task. The project webpage is available at: this https URL.
  - [Probabilistic Volumetric Fusion for Dense Monocular SLAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01276) | [code]
    > We present a novel method to reconstruct 3D scenes from images by leveraging deep dense monocular SLAM and fast uncertainty propagation. The proposed approach is able to 3D reconstruct scenes densely, accurately, and in real-time while being robust to extremely noisy depth estimates coming from dense monocular SLAM. Differently from previous approaches, that either use ad-hoc depth filters, or that estimate the depth uncertainty from RGB-D cameras' sensor models, our probabilistic depth uncertainty derives directly from the information matrix of the underlying bundle adjustment problem in SLAM. We show that the resulting depth uncertainty provides an excellent signal to weight the depth-maps for volumetric fusion. Without our depth uncertainty, the resulting mesh is noisy and with artifacts, while our approach generates an accurate 3D mesh with significantly fewer artifacts. We provide results on the challenging Euroc dataset, and show that our approach achieves 92% better accuracy than directly fusing depths from monocular SLAM, and up to 90% improvements compared to the best competing approach.
  - [NeRF: Neural Radiance Field in 3D Vision, A Comprehensive Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00379) | [code]
    > Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), a new novel view synthesis with implicit scene representation has taken the field of Computer Vision by storm. As a novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction method, NeRF models find applications in robotics, urban mapping, autonomous navigation, virtual reality/augmented reality, and more. Since the original paper by Mildenhall et al., more than 250 preprints were published, with more than 100 eventually being accepted in tier one Computer Vision Conferences. Given NeRF popularity and the current interest in this research area, we believe it necessary to compile a comprehensive survey of NeRF papers from the past two years, which we organized into both architecture, and application based taxonomies. We also provide an introduction to the theory of NeRF based novel view synthesis, and a benchmark comparison of the performance and speed of key NeRF models. By creating this survey, we hope to introduce new researchers to NeRF, provide a helpful reference for influential works in this field, as well as motivate future research directions with our discussion section.

  - [City-scale Incremental Neural Mapping with Three-layer Sampling and Panoptic Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14072) | [code]
    > Neural implicit representations are drawing a lot of attention from the robotics community recently, as they are expressive, continuous and compact. However, city-scale incremental implicit dense mapping based on sparse LiDAR input is still an under-explored challenge. To this end,we successfully build the first city-scale incremental neural mapping system with a panoptic representation that consists of both environment-level and instance-level modelling. Given a stream of sparse LiDAR point cloud, it maintains a dynamic generative model that maps 3D coordinates to signed distance field (SDF) values. To address the difficulty of representing geometric information at different levels in city-scale space, we propose a tailored three-layer sampling strategy to dynamically sample the global, local and near-surface domains. Meanwhile, to realize high fidelity mapping, category-specific prior is introduced to better model the geometric details, leading to a panoptic representation. We evaluate on the public SemanticKITTI dataset and demonstrate the significance of the newly proposed three-layer sampling strategy and panoptic representation, using both quantitative and qualitative results. Codes and data will be publicly available.
  - [Orbeez-SLAM: A Real-time Monocular Visual SLAM with ORB Features and NeRF-realized Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13274) | [code]
    > A spatial AI that can perform complex tasks through visual signals and cooperate with humans is highly anticipated. To achieve this, we need a visual SLAM that easily adapts to new scenes without pre-training and generates dense maps for downstream tasks in real-time. None of the previous learning-based and non-learning-based visual SLAMs satisfy all needs due to the intrinsic limitations of their components. In this work, we develop a visual SLAM named Orbeez-SLAM, which successfully collaborates with implicit neural representation (NeRF) and visual odometry to achieve our goals. Moreover, Orbeez-SLAM can work with the monocular camera since it only needs RGB inputs, making it widely applicable to the real world. We validate its effectiveness on various challenging benchmarks. Results show that our SLAM is up to 800x faster than the strong baseline with superior rendering outcomes.
  - [Enforcing safety for vision-based controllers via Control Barrier Functions and Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12266) | [code]
    > To navigate complex environments, robots must increasingly use high-dimensional visual feedback (e.g. images) for control. However, relying on high-dimensional image data to make control decisions raises important questions; particularly, how might we prove the safety of a visual-feedback controller? Control barrier functions (CBFs) are powerful tools for certifying the safety of feedback controllers in the state-feedback setting, but CBFs have traditionally been poorly-suited to visual feedback control due to the need to predict future observations in order to evaluate the barrier function. In this work, we solve this issue by leveraging recent advances in neural radiance fields (NeRFs), which learn implicit representations of 3D scenes and can render images from previously-unseen camera perspectives, to provide single-step visual foresight for a CBF-based controller. This novel combination is able to filter out unsafe actions and intervene to preserve safety. We demonstrate the effect of our controller in real-time simulation experiments where it successfully prevents the robot from taking dangerous actions.

  - [Local_INN: Implicit Map Representation and Localization with Invertible Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11925) | [code]
    > Robot localization is an inverse problem of finding a robot's pose using a map and sensor measurements. In recent years, Invertible Neural Networks (INNs) have successfully solved ambiguous inverse problems in various fields. This paper proposes a framework that solves the localization problem with INN. We design an INN that provides implicit map representation in the forward path and localization in the inverse path. By sampling the latent space in evaluation, Local\_INN outputs robot poses with covariance, which can be used to estimate the uncertainty. We show that the localization performance of Local\_INN is on par with current methods with much lower latency. We show detailed 2D and 3D map reconstruction from Local\_INN using poses exterior to the training set. We also provide a global localization algorithm using Local\_INN to tackle the kidnapping problem.
  - [NeRF-Loc: Transformer-Based Object Localization Within Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12068) | [code]
    > Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have been successfully used for scene representation. Recent works have also developed robotic navigation and manipulation systems using NeRF-based environment representations. As object localization is the foundation for many robotic applications, to further unleash the potential of NeRFs in robotic systems, we study object localization within a NeRF scene. We propose a transformer-based framework NeRF-Loc to extract 3D bounding boxes of objects in NeRF scenes. NeRF-Loc takes a pre-trained NeRF model and camera view as input, and produces labeled 3D bounding boxes of objects as output. Concretely, we design a pair of paralleled transformer encoder branches, namely the coarse stream and the fine stream, to encode both the context and details of target objects. The encoded features are then fused together with attention layers to alleviate ambiguities for accurate object localization. We have compared our method with the conventional transformer-based method and our method achieves better performance. In addition, we also present the first NeRF samples-based object localization benchmark NeRFLocBench.
  - [How Does It Feel? Self-Supervised Costmap Learning for Off-Road Vehicle Traversability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10788) | [code]
    > Estimating terrain traversability in off-road environments requires reasoning about complex interaction dynamics between the robot and these terrains. However, it is challenging to build an accurate physics model, or create informative labels to learn a model in a supervised manner, for these interactions. We propose a method that learns to predict traversability costmaps by combining exteroceptive environmental information with proprioceptive terrain interaction feedback in a self-supervised manner. Additionally, we propose a novel way of incorporating robot velocity in the costmap prediction pipeline. We validate our method in multiple short and large-scale navigation tasks on a large, autonomous all-terrain vehicle (ATV) on challenging off-road terrains, and demonstrate ease of integration on a separate large ground robot. Our short-scale navigation results show that using our learned costmaps leads to overall smoother navigation, and provides the robot with a more fine-grained understanding of the interactions between the robot and different terrain types, such as grass and gravel. Our large-scale navigation trials show that we can reduce the number of interventions by up to 57% compared to an occupancy-based navigation baseline in challenging off-road courses ranging from 400 m to 3150 m.
  - [Loc-NeRF: Monte Carlo Localization using Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09050) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Loc-NeRF)
    > We present Loc-NeRF, a real-time vision-based robot localization approach that combines Monte Carlo localization and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). Our system uses a pre-trained NeRF model as the map of an environment and can localize itself in real-time using an RGB camera as the only exteroceptive sensor onboard the robot. While neural radiance fields have seen significant applications for visual rendering in computer vision and graphics, they have found limited use in robotics. Existing approaches for NeRF-based localization require both a good initial pose guess and significant computation, making them impractical for real-time robotics applications. By using Monte Carlo localization as a workhorse to estimate poses using a NeRF map model, Loc-NeRF is able to perform localization faster than the state of the art and without relying on an initial pose estimate. In addition to testing on synthetic data, we also run our system using real data collected by a Clearpath Jackal UGV and demonstrate for the first time the ability to perform real-time global localization with neural radiance fields. We make our code publicly available at this https URL.
  - [MeSLAM: Memory Efficient SLAM based on Neural Fields, SMC2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09357) | [code]
    > Existing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) approaches are limited in their scalability due to growing map size in long-term robot operation. Moreover, processing such maps for localization and planning tasks leads to the increased computational resources required onboard. To address the problem of memory consumption in long-term operation, we develop a novel real-time SLAM algorithm, MeSLAM, that is based on neural field implicit map representation. It combines the proposed global mapping strategy, including neural networks distribution and region tracking, with an external odometry system. As a result, the algorithm is able to efficiently train multiple networks representing different map regions and track poses accurately in large-scale environments. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the proposed approach is comparable to the state-of-the-art methods (on average, 6.6 cm on TUM RGB-D sequences) and outperforms the baseline, iMAP∗. Moreover, the proposed SLAM approach provides the most compact-sized maps without details distortion (1.9 MB to store 57 m3) among the state-of-the-art SLAM approaches.
  - [LATITUDE: Robotic Global Localization with Truncated Dynamic Low-pass Filter in City-scale NeRF, ICRA2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08498) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/jike5/LATITUDE)
    > Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have made great success in representing complex 3D scenes with high-resolution details and efficient memory. Nevertheless, current NeRF-based pose estimators have no initial pose prediction and are prone to local optima during optimization. In this paper, we present LATITUDE: Global Localization with Truncated Dynamic Low-pass Filter, which introduces a two-stage localization mechanism in city-scale NeRF. In place recognition stage, we train a regressor through images generated from trained NeRFs, which provides an initial value for global localization. In pose optimization stage, we minimize the residual between the observed image and rendered image by directly optimizing the pose on tangent plane. To avoid convergence to local optimum, we introduce a Truncated Dynamic Low-pass Filter (TDLF) for coarse-to-fine pose registration. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real-world data and show its potential applications for high-precision navigation in large-scale city scenes. Codes and data will be publicly available at this https URL.
  - [Uncertainty Guided Policy for Active Robotic 3D Reconstruction using Neural Radiance Fields, RA-L2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08409) | [code]
    > In this paper, we tackle the problem of active robotic 3D reconstruction of an object. In particular, we study how a mobile robot with an arm-held camera can select a favorable number of views to recover an object's 3D shape efficiently. Contrary to the existing solution to this problem, we leverage the popular neural radiance fields-based object representation, which has recently shown impressive results for various computer vision tasks. However, it is not straightforward to directly reason about an object's explicit 3D geometric details using such a representation, making the next-best-view selection problem for dense 3D reconstruction challenging. This paper introduces a ray-based volumetric uncertainty estimator, which computes the entropy of the weight distribution of the color samples along each ray of the object's implicit neural representation. We show that it is possible to infer the uncertainty of the underlying 3D geometry given a novel view with the proposed estimator. We then present a next-best-view selection policy guided by the ray-based volumetric uncertainty in neural radiance fields-based representations. Encouraging experimental results on synthetic and real-world data suggest that the approach presented in this paper can enable a new research direction of using an implicit 3D object representation for the next-best-view problem in robot vision applications, distinguishing our approach from the existing approaches that rely on explicit 3D geometric modeling.

  - [iDF-SLAM: End-to-End RGB-D SLAM with Neural Implicit Mapping and Deep Feature Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07919) | [code]
    > We propose a novel end-to-end RGB-D SLAM, iDF-SLAM, which adopts a feature-based deep neural tracker as the front-end and a NeRF-style neural implicit mapper as the back-end. The neural implicit mapper is trained on-the-fly, while though the neural tracker is pretrained on the ScanNet dataset, it is also finetuned along with the training of the neural implicit mapper. Under such a design, our iDF-SLAM is capable of learning to use scene-specific features for camera tracking, thus enabling lifelong learning of the SLAM system. Both the training for the tracker and the mapper are self-supervised without introducing ground truth poses. We test the performance of our iDF-SLAM on the Replica and ScanNet datasets and compare the results to the two recent NeRF-based neural SLAM systems. The proposed iDF-SLAM demonstrates state-of-the-art results in terms of scene reconstruction and competitive performance in camera tracking.

    > Next Best View computation (NBV) is a long-standing problem in robotics, and consists in identifying the next most informative sensor position(s) for reconstructing a 3D object or scene efficiently and accurately. Like most current methods, we consider NBV prediction from a depth sensor. Learning-based methods relying on a volumetric representation of the scene are suitable for path planning, but do not scale well with the size of the scene and have lower accuracy than methods using a surface-based representation. However, the latter constrain the camera to a small number of poses. To obtain the advantages of both representations, we show that we can maximize surface metrics by Monte Carlo integration over a volumetric representation. Our method scales to large scenes and handles free camera motion: It takes as input an arbitrarily large point cloud gathered by a depth sensor like Lidar systems as well as camera poses to predict NBV. We demonstrate our approach on a novel dataset made of large and complex 3D scenes.

    > We present a simple baseline for directly estimating the relative pose (rotation and translation, including scale) between two images. Deep methods have recently shown strong progress but often require complex or multi-stage architectures. We show that a handful of modifications can be applied to a Vision Transformer (ViT) to bring its computations close to the Eight-Point Algorithm. This inductive bias enables a simple method to be competitive in multiple settings, often substantially improving over the state of the art with strong performance gains in limited data regimes.

  - [RelPose: Predicting Probabilistic Relative Rotation for Single Objects in the Wild, ECCV2022](https://jasonyzhang.com/relpose/) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/jasonyzhang/relpose)
    > We describe a data-driven method for inferring the camera viewpoints given multiple images of an arbitrary object. This task is a core component of classic geometric pipelines such as SfM and SLAM, and also serves as a vital pre-processing requirement for contemporary neural approaches (e.g. NeRF) to object reconstruction and view synthesis. In contrast to existing correspondence-driven methods that do not perform well given sparse views, we propose a top-down prediction based approach for estimating camera viewpoints. Our key technical insight is the use of an energy-based formulation for representing distributions over relative camera rotations, thus allowing us to explicitly represent multiple camera modes arising from object symmetries or views. Leveraging these relative predictions, we jointly estimate a consistent set of camera rotations from multiple images. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art SfM and SLAM methods given sparse images on both seen and unseen categories. Further, our probabilistic approach significantly outperforms directly regressing relative poses, suggesting that modeling multimodality is important for coherent joint reconstruction. We demonstrate that our system can be a stepping stone toward in-the-wild reconstruction from multi-view datasets. The project page with code and videos can be found at this https URL.

In contrast to most existing approaches based on the signed distance function (SDF) which handles spatial locations, our representation operates on oriented rays. Specifically, PRIF is formulated to directly produce the surface hit point of a given input ray, without the expensive sphere-tracing operations, hence enabling efficient shape extraction and differentiable rendering. We demonstrate that neural networks trained to encode PRIF achieve successes in various tasks including single shape representation, category-wise shape generation, shape completion from sparse or noisy observations, inverse rendering for camera pose estimation, and neural rendering with color.

    > Previous object-level Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) approaches still fail to create high quality object-oriented 3D map in an efficient way. The main challenges come from how to represent the object shape effectively and how to apply such object representation to accurate online camera tracking efficiently. In this paper, we provide ObjectFusion as a novel object-level SLAM in static scenes which efficiently creates object-oriented 3D map with high-quality object reconstruction, by leveraging neural object priors. We propose a neural object representation with only a single encoder–decoder network to effectively express the object shape across various categories, which benefits high quality reconstruction of object instance. More importantly, we propose to convert such neural object representation as precise measurements to jointly optimize the object shape, object pose and camera pose for the final accurate 3D object reconstruction. With extensive evaluations on synthetic and real-world RGB-D datasets, we show that our ObjectFusion outperforms previous approaches, with better object reconstruction quality, using much less memory footprint, and in a more efficient way, especially at the object level.
  - [Neural Density-Distance Fields, ECCV2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14455) | [***``[code]``***](https://ueda0319.github.io/neddf/)
    > The success of neural fields for 3D vision tasks is now indisputable. Following this trend, several methods aiming for visual localization (e.g., SLAM) have been proposed to estimate distance or density fields using neural fields. However, it is difficult to achieve high localization performance by only density fields-based methods such as Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) since they do not provide density gradient in most empty regions. On the other hand, distance field-based methods such as Neural Implicit Surface (NeuS) have limitations in objects' surface shapes. This paper proposes Neural Density-Distance Field (NeDDF), a novel 3D representation that reciprocally constrains the distance and density fields. We extend distance field formulation to shapes with no explicit boundary surface, such as fur or smoke, which enable explicit conversion from distance field to density field. Consistent distance and density fields realized by explicit conversion enable both robustness to initial values and high-quality registration. Furthermore, the consistency between fields allows fast convergence from sparse point clouds. Experiments show that NeDDF can achieve high localization performance while providing comparable results to NeRF on novel view synthesis. The code is available at this https URL.

    > Our method studies the complex task of object-centric 3D understanding from a single RGB-D observation. As it is an ill-posed problem, existing methods suffer from low performance for both 3D shape and 6D pose and size estimation in complex multi-object scenarios with occlusions. We present ShAPO, a method for joint multi-object detection, 3D textured reconstruction, 6D object pose and size estimation. Key to ShAPO is a single-shot pipeline to regress shape, appearance and pose latent codes along with the masks of each object instance, which is then further refined in a sparse-to-dense fashion. A novel disentangled shape and appearance database of priors is first learned to embed objects in their respective shape and appearance space. We also propose a novel, octree-based differentiable optimization step, allowing us to further improve object shape, pose and appearance simultaneously under the learned latent space, in an analysis-by-synthesis fashion. Our novel joint implicit textured object representation allows us to accurately identify and reconstruct novel unseen objects without having access to their 3D meshes. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method, trained on simulated indoor scenes, accurately regresses the shape, appearance and pose of novel objects in the real-world with minimal fine-tuning. Our method significantly out-performs all baselines on the NOCS dataset with an 8% absolute improvement in mAP for 6D pose estimation.

    > We introduce GAUDI, a generative model capable of capturing the distribution of complex and realistic 3D scenes that can be rendered immersively from a moving camera. We tackle this challenging problem with a scalable yet powerful approach, where we first optimize a latent representation that disentangles radiance fields and camera poses. This latent representation is then used to learn a generative model that enables both unconditional and conditional generation of 3D scenes. Our model generalizes previous works that focus on single objects by removing the assumption that the camera pose distribution can be shared across samples. We show that GAUDI obtains state-of-the-art performance in the unconditional generative setting across multiple datasets and allows for conditional generation of 3D scenes given conditioning variables like sparse image observations or text that describes the scene.

    > Recent work achieved impressive progress towards joint reconstruction of hands and manipulated objects from monocular color images. Existing methods focus on two alternative representations in terms of either parametric meshes or signed distance fields (SDFs). On one side, parametric models can benefit from prior knowledge at the cost of limited shape deformations and mesh resolutions. Mesh models, hence, may fail to precisely reconstruct details such as contact surfaces of hands and objects. SDF-based methods, on the other side, can represent arbitrary details but are lacking explicit priors. In this work we aim to improve SDF models using priors provided by parametric representations. In particular, we propose a joint learning framework that disentangles the pose and the shape. We obtain hand and object poses from parametric models and use them to align SDFs in 3D space. We show that such aligned SDFs better focus on reconstructing shape details and improve reconstruction accuracy both for hands and objects. We evaluate our method and demonstrate significant improvements over the state of the art on the challenging ObMan and DexYCB benchmarks.

    > We present a learning-based method for synthesizing novel views of complex scenes using only unstructured collections of in-the-wild photographs. We build on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), which uses the weights of a multilayer perceptron to model the density and color of a scene as a function of 3D coordinates. While NeRF works well on images of static subjects captured under controlled settings, it is incapable of modeling many ubiquitous, real-world phenomena in uncontrolled images, such as variable illumination or transient occluders. We introduce a series of extensions to NeRF to address these issues, thereby enabling accurate reconstructions from unstructured image collections taken from the internet. We apply our system, dubbed NeRF-W, to internet photo collections of famous landmarks, and demonstrate temporally consistent novel view renderings that are significantly closer to photorealism than the prior state of the art.

    > Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has recently gained popularity for its impressive novel view synthesis ability. This paper studies the problem of hallucinated NeRF: i.e., recovering a realistic NeRF at a different time of day from a group of tourism images. Existing solutions adopt NeRF with a controllable appearance embedding to render novel views under various conditions, but they cannot render view-consistent images with an unseen appearance. To solve this problem, we present an end-to-end framework for constructing a hallucinated NeRF, dubbed as Ha-NeRF. Specifically, we propose an appearance hallucination module to handle time-varying appearances and transfer them to novel views. Considering the complex occlusions of tourism images, we introduce an anti-occlusion module to decompose the static subjects for visibility accurately. Experimental results on synthetic data and real tourism photo collections demonstrate that our method can hallucinate the desired appearances and render occlusion-free images from different views.

    > We present the first method capable of photorealistically reconstructing deformable scenes using photos/videos captured casually from mobile phones. Our approach augments neural radiance fields (NeRF) by optimizing an additional continuous volumetric deformation field that warps each observed point into a canonical 5D NeRF. We observe that these NeRF-like deformation fields are prone to local minima, and propose a coarse-to-fine optimization method for coordinate-based models that allows for more robust optimization. By adapting principles from geometry processing and physical simulation to NeRF-like models, we propose an elastic regularization of the deformation field that further improves robustness. We show that our method can turn casually captured selfie photos/videos into deformable NeRF models that allow for photorealistic renderings of the subject from arbitrary viewpoints, which we dub "nerfies." We evaluate our method by collecting time-synchronized data using a rig with two mobile phones, yielding train/validation images of the same pose at different viewpoints. We show that our method faithfully reconstructs non-rigidly deforming scenes and reproduces unseen views with high fidelity.

    > We present dynamic neural radiance fields for modeling the appearance and dynamics of a human face. Digitally modeling and reconstructing a talking human is a key building-block for a variety of applications. Especially, for telepresence applications in AR or VR, a faithful reproduction of the appearance including novel viewpoint or head-poses is required. In contrast to state-of-the-art approaches that model the geometry and material properties explicitly, or are purely image-based, we introduce an implicit representation of the head based on scene representation networks. To handle the dynamics of the face, we combine our scene representation network with a low-dimensional morphable model which provides explicit control over pose and expressions. We use volumetric rendering to generate images from this hybrid representation and demonstrate that such a dynamic neural scene representation can be learned from monocular input data only, without the need of a specialized capture setup. In our experiments, we show that this learned volumetric representation allows for photo-realistic image generation that surpasses the quality of state-of-the-art video-based reenactment methods.
  - [Neural Articulated Radiance Field, ICCV2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03110) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/nogu-atsu/NARF#code)
    > We present Neural Articulated Radiance Field (NARF), a novel deformable 3D representation for articulated objects learned from images. While recent advances in 3D implicit representation have made it possible to learn models of complex objects, learning pose-controllable representations of articulated objects remains a challenge, as current methods require 3D shape supervision and are unable to render appearance. In formulating an implicit representation of 3D articulated objects, our method considers only the rigid transformation of the most relevant object part in solving for the radiance field at each 3D location. In this way, the proposed method represents pose-dependent changes without significantly increasing the computational complexity. NARF is fully differentiable and can be trained from images with pose annotations. Moreover, through the use of an autoencoder, it can learn appearance variations over multiple instances of an object class. Experiments show that the proposed method is efficient and can generalize well to novel poses.

    > We propose Neural Actor (NA), a new method for high-quality synthesis of humans from arbitrary viewpoints and under arbitrary controllable poses. Our method is built upon recent neural scene representation and rendering works which learn representations of geometry and appearance from only 2D images. While existing works demonstrated compelling rendering of static scenes and playback of dynamic scenes, photo-realistic reconstruction and rendering of humans with neural implicit methods, in particular under user-controlled novel poses, is still difficult. To address this problem, we utilize a coarse body model as the proxy to unwarp the surrounding 3D space into a canonical pose. A neural radiance field learns pose-dependent geometric deformations and pose- and view-dependent appearance effects in the canonical space from multi-view video input. To synthesize novel views of high fidelity dynamic geometry and appearance, we leverage 2D texture maps defined on the body model as latent variables for predicting residual deformations and the dynamic appearance. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves better quality than the state-of-the-arts on playback as well as novel pose synthesis, and can even generalize well to new poses that starkly differ from the training poses. Furthermore, our method also supports body shape control of the synthesized results.

    > We present iNeRF, a framework that performs pose estimation by “inverting” a trained Neural Radiance Field(NeRF). NeRFs have been shown to be remarkably effective for the task of view synthesis — synthesizing photorealisticnovel views of real-world scenes or objects. In this work, we investigate whether we can apply analysis-by-synthesis with NeRF for 6DoF pose estimation – given an image, find the translation and rotation of a camera relative to a 3Dmodel. Starting from an initial pose estimate, we use gradient descent to minimize the residual between pixels rendered from an already-trained NeRF and pixels in an observed image. In our experiments, we first study 1) how to sample rays during pose refinement for iNeRF to collect informative gradients and 2) how different batch sizes ofrays affect iNeRF on a synthetic dataset. We then show that for complex real-world scenes from the LLFF dataset, iNeRF can improve NeRF by estimating the camera poses of novel images and using these images as additional trainingdata for NeRF. Finally, we show iNeRF can be combinedwith feature-based pose initialization. The approach outperforms all other RGB-based methods relying on syntheticdata on LineMOD.

    > While deep learning reshaped the classical motion capture pipeline with feed-forward networks, generative models are required to recover fine alignment via iterative refinement. Unfortunately, the existing models are usually hand-crafted or learned in controlled conditions, only applicable to limited domains. We propose a method to learn a generative neural body model from unlabelled monocular videos by extending Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). We equip them with a skeleton to apply to time-varying and articulated motion. A key insight is that implicit models require the inverse of the forward kinematics used in explicit surface models. Our reparameterization defines spatial latent variables relative to the pose of body parts and thereby overcomes ill-posed inverse operations with an overparameterization. This enables learning volumetric body shape and appearance from scratch while jointly refining the articulated pose; all without ground truth labels for appearance, pose, or 3D shape on the input videos. When used for novel-view-synthesis and motion capture, our neural model improves accuracy on diverse datasets. Project website: this https URL .
  - [NeRF--: Neural Radiance Fields Without Known Camera Parameters](https://nerfmm.active.vision/) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/ActiveVisionLab/nerfmm)
    > Considering the problem of novel view synthesis (NVS) from only a set of 2D images, we simplify the training process of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) on forward-facing scenes by removing the requirement of known or pre-computed camera parameters, including both intrinsics and 6DoF poses. To this end, we propose NeRF−−, with three contributions: First, we show that the camera parameters can be jointly optimised as learnable parameters with NeRF training, through a photometric reconstruction; Second, to benchmark the camera parameter estimation and the quality of novel view renderings, we introduce a new dataset of path-traced synthetic scenes, termed as Blender Forward-Facing Dataset (BLEFF); Third, we conduct extensive analyses to understand the training behaviours under various camera motions, and show that in most scenarios, the joint optimisation pipeline can recover accurate camera parameters and achieve comparable novel view synthesis quality as those trained with COLMAP pre-computed camera parameters.

    > We show for the first time that a multilayer perceptron (MLP) can serve as the only scene representation in a real-time SLAM system for a handheld RGB-D camera. Our network is trained in live operation without prior data, building a dense, scene-specific implicit 3D model of occupancy and colour which is also immediately used for tracking.

    > Neural implicit representations have recently shown encouraging results in various domains, including promising progress in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Nevertheless, existing methods produce over-smoothed scene reconstructions and have difficulty scaling up to large scenes. These limitations are mainly due to their simple fully-connected network architecture that does not incorporate local information in the observations. In this paper, we present NICE-SLAM, a dense SLAM system that incorporates multi-level local information by introducing a hierarchical scene representation. Optimizing this representation with pre-trained geometric priors enables detailed reconstruction on large indoor scenes. Compared to recent neural implicit SLAM systems, our approach is more scalable, efficient, and robust. Experiments on five challenging datasets demonstrate competitive results of NICE-SLAM in both mapping and tracking quality.
  - [GNeRF: GAN-based Neural Radiance Field without Posed Camera, ICCV2021(oral)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15606) | [code]
    > We introduce GNeRF, a framework to marry Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) with Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) reconstruction for the complex scenarios with unknown and even randomly initialized camera poses. Recent NeRF-based advances have gained popularity for remarkable realistic novel view synthesis. However, most of them heavily rely on accurate camera poses estimation, while few recent methods can only optimize the unknown camera poses in roughly forward-facing scenes with relatively short camera trajectories and require rough camera poses initialization. Differently, our GNeRF only utilizes randomly initialized poses for complex outside-in scenarios. We propose a novel two-phases end-to-end framework. The first phase takes the use of GANs into the new realm for optimizing coarse camera poses and radiance fields jointly, while the second phase refines them with additional photometric loss. We overcome local minima using a hybrid and iterative optimization scheme. Extensive experiments on a variety of synthetic and natural scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of GNeRF. More impressively, our approach outperforms the baselines favorably in those scenes with repeated patterns or even low textures that are regarded as extremely challenging before.

    > Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have recently gained a surge of interest within the computer vision community for its power to synthesize photorealistic novel views of real-world scenes. One limitation of NeRF, however, is its requirement of accurate camera poses to learn the scene representations. In this paper, we propose Bundle-Adjusting Neural Radiance Fields (BARF) for training NeRF from imperfect (or even unknown) camera poses — the joint problem of learning neural 3D representations and registering camera frames. We establish a theoretical connection to classical image alignment and show that coarse-to-fine registration is also applicable to NeRF. Furthermore, we show that naively applying positional encoding in NeRF has a negative impact on registration with a synthesis-based objective. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that BARF can effectively optimize the neural scene representations and resolve large camera pose misalignment at the same time. This enables view synthesis and localization of video sequences from unknown camera poses, opening up new avenues for visual localization systems (e.g. SLAM) and potential applications for dense 3D mapping and reconstruction.
  - [Self-Calibrating Neural Radiance Fields, ICCV2021](https://postech-cvlab.github.io/SCNeRF/) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/POSTECH-CVLab/SCNeRF)
    > In this work, we propose a camera self-calibration algorithm for generic cameras with arbitrary non-linear distortions. We jointly learn the geometry of the scene and the accurate camera parameters without any calibration objects. Our camera model consists a pinhole model, radial distortion, and a generic noise model that can learn arbitrary non-linear camera distortions. While traditional self-calibration algorithms mostly rely on geometric constraints, we additionally incorporate photometric consistency. This requires learning the geometry of the scene and we use Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). We also propose a new geometric loss function, viz., projected ray distance loss, to incorporate geometric consistency for complex non-linear camera models. We validate our approach on standard real image datasets and demonstrate our model can learn the camera intrinsics and extrinsics (pose) from scratch without COLMAP initialization. Also, we show that learning accurate camera models in differentiable manner allows us to improves PSNR over NeRF. We experimentally demonstrate that our proposed method is applicable to variants of NeRF. In addition, we use a set of images captured with a fish-eye lens to demonstrate that learning camera model jointly improves the performance significantly over the COLMAP initialization.

    > Recent implicit neural rendering methods have demonstrated that it is possible to learn accurate view synthesis for complex scenes by predicting their volumetric density and color supervised solely by a set of RGB images. However, existing methods are restricted to learning efficient representations of static scenes that encode all scene objects into a single neural network, and lack the ability to represent dynamic scenes and decompositions into individual scene objects. In this work, we present the first neural rendering method that decomposes dynamic scenes into scene graphs. We propose a learned scene graph representation, which encodes object transformation and radiance, to efficiently render novel arrangements and views of the scene. To this end, we learn implicitly encoded scenes, combined with a jointly learned latent representation to describe objects with a single implicit function. We assess the proposed method on synthetic and real automotive data, validating that our approach learns dynamic scenes -- only by observing a video of this scene -- and allows for rendering novel photo-realistic views of novel scene compositions with unseen sets of objects at unseen poses.
