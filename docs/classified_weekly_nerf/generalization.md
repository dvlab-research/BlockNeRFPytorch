  - [NeSF: Neural Semantic Fields for Generalizable Semantic Segmentation of 3D Scenes](https://research.google/pubs/pub51563/) | [code]
    > We present NeSF, a method for producing 3D semantic fields from pre-trained density fields and sparse 2D semantic supervision. Our method side-steps traditional scene representations by leveraging neural representations where 3D information is stored within neural fields. In spite of being supervised by 2D signals alone, our method is able to generate 3D-consistent semantic maps from novel camera poses and can be queried at arbitrary 3D points. Notably, NeSF is compatible with any method producing a density field, and its accuracy improves as the quality of the pre-trained density fields improve. Our empirical analysis demonstrates comparable quality to competitive 2D and 3D semantic segmentation baselines on convincing synthetic scenes while also offering features unavailable to existing methods.

    > Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged and shown their benefits over discrete representations in recent years. However, fitting an INR to the given observations usually requires optimization with gradient descent from scratch, which is inefficient and does not generalize well with sparse observations. To address this problem, most of the prior works train a hypernetwork that generates a single vector to modulate the INR weights, where the single vector becomes an information bottleneck that limits the reconstruction precision of the output INR. Recent work shows that the whole set of weights in INR can be precisely inferred without the single-vector bottleneck by gradient-based meta-learning. Motivated by a generalized formulation of gradient-based meta-learning, we propose a formulation that uses Transformers as hypernetworks for INRs, where it can directly build the whole set of INR weights with Transformers specialized as set-to-set mapping. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for building INRs in different tasks and domains, including 2D image regression and view synthesis for 3D objects. Our work draws connections between the Transformer hypernetworks and gradient-based meta-learning algorithms and we provide further analysis for understanding the generated INRs.
  - [VolTeMorph: Realtime, Controllable and Generalisable Animation of Volumetric Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.00949) | [***``[code]``***](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.00949)
    > The recent increase in popularity of volumetric representations for scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis has put renewed focus on animating volumetric content at high visual quality and in real-time. While implicit deformation methods based on learned functions can produce impressive results, they are `black boxes' to artists and content creators, they require large amounts of training data to generalise meaningfully, and they do not produce realistic extrapolations outside the training data. In this work we solve these issues by introducing a volume deformation method which is real-time, easy to edit with off-the-shelf software and can extrapolate convincingly. To demonstrate the versatility of our method, we apply it in two scenarios: physics-based object deformation and telepresence where avatars are controlled using blendshapes. We also perform thorough experiments showing that our method compares favourably to both volumetric approaches combined with implicit deformation and methods based on mesh deformation.

  - [ZEPI-Net: Light Field Super Resolution via Internal Cross-Scale Epipolar Plane Image Zero-Shot Learning, Neural Processing Letters (2022)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11063-022-10955-x) | [code]
    > Many applications of light field (LF) imaging have been limited by the spatial-angular resolution problem, hence the need for efficient super-resolution techniques. Recently, learning-based solutions have achieved remarkably better performances than traditional super-resolution (SR) techniques. Unfortunately, the learning or training process relies heavily on the training dataset, which could be limited for most LF imaging applications. In this paper, we propose a novel LF spatial-angular SR algorithm based on zero-shot learning. We suggest learning cross-scale reusable features in the epipolar plane image (EPI) space, and avoiding explicitly modeling scene priors or implicitly learning that from a large number of LFs. Most importantly, without using any external LFs, the proposed algorithm can simultaneously super-resolve a LF in both spatial and angular domains. Moreover, the proposed solution is free of depth or disparity estimation, which is usually employed by existing LF spatial and angular SR. By using a simple 8-layers fully convolutional network, we show that the proposed algorithm can generate comparable results to the state-of-the-art spatial SR. Our algorithm outperforms the existing methods in terms of angular SR on multiple groups of public LF datasets. The experiment results indicate that the cross-scale features can be well learned and be reused for LF SR in the EPI space.
  - [ObjectFusion: Accurate object-level SLAM with neural object priors, Graphical Models, Volume 123, September 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1524070322000418) | [code]
    > Previous object-level Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) approaches still fail to create high quality object-oriented 3D map in an efficient way. The main challenges come from how to represent the object shape effectively and how to apply such object representation to accurate online camera tracking efficiently. In this paper, we provide ObjectFusion as a novel object-level SLAM in static scenes which efficiently creates object-oriented 3D map with high-quality object reconstruction, by leveraging neural object priors. We propose a neural object representation with only a single encoderâ€“decoder network to effectively express the object shape across various categories, which benefits high quality reconstruction of object instance. More importantly, we propose to convert such neural object representation as precise measurements to jointly optimize the object shape, object pose and camera pose for the final accurate 3D object reconstruction. With extensive evaluations on synthetic and real-world RGB-D datasets, we show that our ObjectFusion outperforms previous approaches, with better object reconstruction quality, using much less memory footprint, and in a more efficient way, especially at the object level.
  - [End-to-end View Synthesis via NeRF Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14741) | [code]
    > In this paper, we present a simple seq2seq formulation for view synthesis where we take a set of ray points as input and output colors corresponding to the rays. Directly applying a standard transformer on this seq2seq formulation has two limitations. First, the standard attention cannot successfully fit the volumetric rendering procedure, and therefore high-frequency components are missing in the synthesized views. Second, applying global attention to all rays and pixels is extremely inefficient. Inspired by the neural radiance field (NeRF), we propose the NeRF attention (NeRFA) to address the above problems. On the one hand, NeRFA considers the volumetric rendering equation as a soft feature modulation procedure. In this way, the feature modulation enhances the transformers with the NeRF-like inductive bias. On the other hand, NeRFA performs multi-stage attention to reduce the computational overhead. Furthermore, the NeRFA model adopts the ray and pixel transformers to learn the interactions between rays and pixels. NeRFA demonstrates superior performance over NeRF and NerFormer on four datasets: DeepVoxels, Blender, LLFF, and CO3D. Besides, NeRFA establishes a new state-of-the-art under two settings: the single-scene view synthesis and the category-centric novel view synthesis. The code will be made publicly available.
