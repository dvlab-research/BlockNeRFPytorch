  - [FoV-NeRF: Foveated Neural Radiance Fields for Virtual Reality, TVCG2022](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9872532) | [code]
    > Virtual Reality (VR) is becoming ubiquitous with the rise of consumer displays and commercial VR platforms. Such displays require low latency and high quality rendering of synthetic imagery with reduced compute overheads. Recent advances in neural rendering showed promise of unlocking new possibilities in 3D computer graphics via image-based representations of virtual or physical environments. Specifically, the neural radiance fields (NeRF) demonstrated that photo-realistic quality and continuous view changes of 3D scenes can be achieved without loss of view-dependent effects. While NeRF can significantly benefit rendering for VR applications, it faces unique challenges posed by high field-of-view, high resolution, and stereoscopic/egocentric viewing, typically causing low quality and high latency of the rendered images. In VR, this not only harms the interaction experience but may also cause sickness. To tackle these problems toward six-degrees-of-freedom, egocentric, and stereo NeRF in VR, we present the first gaze-contingent 3D neural representation and view synthesis method . We incorporate the human psychophysics of visual- and stereo-acuity into an egocentric neural representation of 3D scenery. We then jointly optimize the latency/performance and visual quality while mutually bridging human perception and neural scene synthesis to achieve perceptually high-quality immersive interaction. We conducted both objective analysis and subjective studies to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. We find that our method significantly reduces latency (up to 99% time reduction compared with NeRF) without loss of high-fidelity rendering (perceptually identical to full-resolution ground truth). The presented approach may serve as the first step toward future VR/AR systems that capture, teleport, and visualize remote environments in real-time.
  - [CLONeR: Camera-Lidar Fusion for Occupancy Grid-aided Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01194) | [code]
    > This paper proposes CLONeR, which significantly improves upon NeRF by allowing it to model large outdoor driving scenes that are observed from sparse input sensor views. This is achieved by decoupling occupancy and color learning within the NeRF framework into separate Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) trained using LiDAR and camera data, respectively. In addition, this paper proposes a novel method to build differentiable 3D Occupancy Grid Maps (OGM) alongside the NeRF model, and leverage this occupancy grid for improved sampling of points along a ray for volumetric rendering in metric space.

  - [Voxurf: Voxel-based Efficient and Accurate Neural Surface Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12697) | [code]
    > Neural surface reconstruction aims to reconstruct accurate 3D surfaces based on multi-view images. Previous methods based on neural volume rendering mostly train a fully implicit model, and they require hours of training for a single scene. Recent efforts explore the explicit volumetric representation, which substantially accelerates the optimization process by memorizing significant information in learnable voxel grids. However, these voxel-based methods often struggle in reconstructing fine-grained geometry. Through empirical studies, we found that high-quality surface reconstruction hinges on two key factors: the capability of constructing a coherent shape and the precise modeling of color-geometry dependency. In particular, the latter is the key to the accurate reconstruction of fine details. Inspired by these findings, we develop Voxurf, a voxel-based approach for efficient and accurate neural surface reconstruction, which consists of two stages: 1) leverage a learnable feature grid to construct the color field and obtain a coherent coarse shape, and 2) refine detailed geometry with a dual color network that captures precise color-geometry dependency. We further introduce a hierarchical geometry feature to enable information sharing across voxels. Our experiments show that Voxurf achieves high efficiency and high quality at the same time. On the DTU benchmark, Voxurf achieves higher reconstruction quality compared to state-of-the-art methods, with 20x speedup in training.

This representation can be optimized from calibrated images via gradient methods and regularization without any neural components. On standard, benchmark tasks, Plenoxels are optimized two orders of magnitude faster than Neural Radiance Fields with no loss in visual quality.

  - [E-NeRF: Neural Radiance Fields from a Moving Event Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11300) | [code]
    > Estimating neural radiance fields (NeRFs) from ideal images has been extensively studied in the computer vision community. Most approaches assume optimal illumination and slow camera motion. These assumptions are often violated in robotic applications, where images contain motion blur and the scene may not have suitable illumination. This can cause significant problems for downstream tasks such as navigation, inspection or visualization of the scene. To alleviate these problems we present E-NeRF, the first method which estimates a volumetric scene representation in the form of a NeRF from a fast-moving event camera. Our method can recover NeRFs during very fast motion and in high dynamic range conditions, where frame-based approaches fail. We show that rendering high-quality frames is possible by only providing an event stream as input. Furthermore, by combining events and frames, we can estimate NeRFs of higher quality than state-of-the-art approaches under severe motion blur. We also show that combining events and frames can overcome failure cases of NeRF estimation in scenarios where only few input views are available, without requiring additional regularization.

  - [PDRF: Progressively Deblurring Radiance Field for Fast and Robust Scene Reconstruction from Blurry Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08049) | [code]
    > We present Progressively Deblurring Radiance Field (PDRF), a novel approach to efficiently reconstruct high quality radiance fields from blurry images. While current State-of-The-Art (SoTA) scene reconstruction methods achieve photo-realistic rendering results from clean source views, their performances suffer when the source views are affected by blur, which is commonly observed for images in the wild. Previous deblurring methods either do not account for 3D geometry, or are computationally intense. To addresses these issues, PDRF, a progressively deblurring scheme in radiance field modeling, accurately models blur by incorporating 3D scene context. PDRF further uses an efficient importance sampling scheme, which results in fast scene optimization. Specifically, PDRF proposes a Coarse Ray Renderer to quickly estimate voxel density and feature; a Fine Voxel Renderer is then used to achieve high quality ray tracing. We perform extensive experiments and show that PDRF is 15X faster than previous SoTA while achieving better performance on both synthetic and real scenes.
  - [HDR-Plenoxels: Self-Calibrating High Dynamic Range Radiance Fields, ECCV2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06787) | [code]
    > We propose high dynamic range radiance (HDR) fields, HDR-Plenoxels, that learn a plenoptic function of 3D HDR radiance fields, geometry information, and varying camera settings inherent in 2D low dynamic range (LDR) images. Our voxel-based volume rendering pipeline reconstructs HDR radiance fields with only multi-view LDR images taken from varying camera settings in an end-to-end manner and has a fast convergence speed. To deal with various cameras in real-world scenarios, we introduce a tone mapping module that models the digital in-camera imaging pipeline (ISP) and disentangles radiometric settings. Our tone mapping module allows us to render by controlling the radiometric settings of each novel view. Finally, we build a multi-view dataset with varying camera conditions, which fits our problem setting. Our experiments show that HDR-Plenoxels can express detail and high-quality HDR novel views from only LDR images with various cameras.

  - [OmniVoxel: A Fast and Precise Reconstruction Method of Omnidirectional Neural Radiance Field, GCCE 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06335) | [code]
    > This paper proposes a method to reconstruct the neural radiance field with equirectangular omnidirectional images. Implicit neural scene representation with a radiance field can reconstruct the 3D shape of a scene continuously within a limited spatial area. However, training a fully implicit representation on commercial PC hardware requires a lot of time and computing resources (15Â â¼Â 20 hours per scene). Therefore, we propose a method to accelerate this process significantly (20Â â¼Â 40 minutes per scene). Instead of using a fully implicit representation of rays for radiance field reconstruction, we adopt feature voxels that contain density and color features in tensors. Considering omnidirectional equirectangular input and the camera layout, we use spherical voxelization for representation instead of cubic representation. Our voxelization method could balance the reconstruction quality of the inner scene and outer scene. In addition, we adopt the axis-aligned positional encoding method on the color features to increase the total image quality. Our method achieves satisfying empirical performance on synthetic datasets with random camera poses. Moreover, we test our method with real scenes which contain complex geometries and also achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our code and complete dataset will be released at the same time as the paper publication.
  - [HRF-Net: Holistic Radiance Fields from Sparse Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04717) | [code]
    > We present HRF-Net, a novel view synthesis method based on holistic radiance fields that renders novel views using a set of sparse inputs. Recent generalizing view synthesis methods also leverage the radiance fields but the rendering speed is not real-time. There are existing methods that can train and render novel views efficiently but they can not generalize to unseen scenes. Our approach addresses the problem of real-time rendering for generalizing view synthesis and consists of two main stages: a holistic radiance fields predictor and a convolutional-based neural renderer. This architecture infers not only consistent scene geometry based on the implicit neural fields but also renders new views efficiently using a single GPU. We first train HRF-Net on multiple 3D scenes of the DTU dataset and the network can produce plausible novel views on unseen real and synthetics data using only photometric losses. Moreover, our method can leverage a denser set of reference images of a single scene to produce accurate novel views without relying on additional explicit representations and still maintains the high-speed rendering of the pre-trained model. Experimental results show that HRF-Net outperforms state-of-the-art generalizable neural rendering methods on various synthetic and real datasets.

    > Computer-generated holography (CGH) provides volumetric control of coherent wavefront and is fundamental to applications such as volumetric 3D displays, lithography, neural photostimulation, and optical/acoustic trapping. Recently, deep learning-based methods emerged as promising computational paradigms for CGH synthesis that overcome the quality-runtime tradeoff in conventional simulation/optimization-based methods. Yet, the quality of the predicted hologram is intrinsically bounded by the datasetâs quality. Here we introduce a new hologram dataset, MIT-CGH-4K-V2, that uses a layered depth image as a data-efficient volumetric 3D input and a two-stage supervised+unsupervised training protocol for direct synthesis of high-quality 3D phase-only holograms. The proposed system also corrects vision aberration, allowing customization for end-users. We experimentally show photorealistic 3D holographic projections and discuss relevant spatial light modulator calibration procedures. Our method runs in real-time on a consumer GPU and 5 FPS on an iPhone 13 Pro, promising drastically enhanced performance for the applications above.

    > Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated amazing ability to synthesize images of 3D scenes from novel views. However, they rely upon specialized volumetric rendering algorithms based on ray marching that are mismatched to the capabilities of widely deployed graphics hardware. This paper introduces a new NeRF representation based on textured polygons that can synthesize novel images efficiently with standard rendering pipelines. The NeRF is represented as a set of polygons with textures representing binary opacities and feature vectors. Traditional rendering of the polygons with a z-buffer yields an image with features at every pixel, which are interpreted by a small, view-dependent MLP running in a fragment shader to produce a final pixel color. This approach enables NeRFs to be rendered with the traditional polygon rasterization pipeline, which provides massive pixel-level parallelism, achieving interactive frame rates on a wide range of compute platforms, including mobile phones.
  - [End-to-end View Synthesis via NeRF Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14741) | [code]
    > In this paper, we present a simple seq2seq formulation for view synthesis where we take a set of ray points as input and output colors corresponding to the rays. Directly applying a standard transformer on this seq2seq formulation has two limitations. First, the standard attention cannot successfully fit the volumetric rendering procedure, and therefore high-frequency components are missing in the synthesized views. Second, applying global attention to all rays and pixels is extremely inefficient. Inspired by the neural radiance field (NeRF), we propose the NeRF attention (NeRFA) to address the above problems. On the one hand, NeRFA considers the volumetric rendering equation as a soft feature modulation procedure. In this way, the feature modulation enhances the transformers with the NeRF-like inductive bias. On the other hand, NeRFA performs multi-stage attention to reduce the computational overhead. Furthermore, the NeRFA model adopts the ray and pixel transformers to learn the interactions between rays and pixels. NeRFA demonstrates superior performance over NeRF and NerFormer on four datasets: DeepVoxels, Blender, LLFF, and CO3D. Besides, NeRFA establishes a new state-of-the-art under two settings: the single-scene view synthesis and the category-centric novel view synthesis. The code will be made publicly available.
  - [Going Off-Grid: Continuous Implicit Neural Representations for 3D Vascular Modeling, MICCAI STACOM 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14663) | [code]
    > Personalised 3D vascular models are valuable for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment planning in patients with cardiovascular disease. Traditionally, such models have been constructed with explicit representations such as meshes and voxel masks, or implicit representations such as radial basis functions or atomic (tubular) shapes. Here, we propose to represent surfaces by the zero level set of their signed distance function (SDF) in a differentiable implicit neural representation (INR). This allows us to model complex vascular structures with a representation that is implicit, continuous, light-weight, and easy to integrate with deep learning algorithms. We here demonstrate the potential of this approach with three practical examples. First, we obtain an accurate and watertight surface for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) from CT images and show robust fitting from as little as 200 points on the surface. Second, we simultaneously fit nested vessel walls in a single INR without intersections. Third, we show how 3D models of individual arteries can be smoothly blended into a single watertight surface. Our results show that INRs are a flexible representation with potential for minimally interactive annotation and manipulation of complex vascular structures.

  - [Neural Sparse Voxel Fields, NeurIPS2020](https://lingjie0206.github.io/papers/NSVF/) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/facebookresearch/NSVF)
    > We introduce Neural Sparse Voxel Fields (NSVF), a new neural scene representation for fast and high-quality free-viewpoint rendering. NSVF defines a set of voxel-bounded implicit fields organized in a sparse voxel octree to model local properties in each cell. We progressively learn the underlying voxel structures with a diffentiable ray-marching operation from only a set of posed RGB images. With the sparse voxel octree structure, rendering novel views can be accelerated by skipping the voxels containing no relevant scene content. Our method is over 10 times faster than the state-of-the-art (namely, NeRF (Mildenhall et al., 2020)) at inference time while achieving higher quality results. Furthermore, by utilizing an explicit sparse voxel representation, our method can easily be applied to scene editing and scene composition. We also demonstrate several challenging tasks, including multi-scene learning, free-viewpoint rendering of a moving human, and large-scale scene rendering.
  - [AutoInt: Automatic Integration for Fast Neural Volume Rendering, CVPR2021](http://www.computationalimaging.org/publications/automatic-integration/) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/computational-imaging/automatic-integration)
    > Numerical integration is a foundational technique in scientific computing and is at the core of many computer vision applications. Among these applications, implicit neural volume rendering has recently been proposed as a new paradigm for view synthesis, achieving photorealistic image quality. However, a fundamental obstacle to making these methods practical is the extreme computational and memory requirements caused by the required volume integrations along the rendered rays during training and inference. Millions of rays, each requiring hundreds of forward passes through a neural network are needed to approximate those integrations with Monte Carlo sampling. Here, we propose automatic integration, a new framework for learning efficient, closed-form solutions to integrals using implicit neural representation networks. For training, we instantiate the computational graph corresponding to the derivative of the implicit neural representation. The graph is fitted to the signal to integrate. After optimization, we reassemble the graph to obtain a network that represents the antiderivative. By the fundamental theorem of calculus, this enables the calculation of any definite integral in two evaluations of the network. Using this approach, we demonstrate a greater than 10Ã improvement in computation requirements, enabling fast neural volume rendering.
  - [DeRF: Decomposed Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12490) | [code]
    > With the advent of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), neural networks can now render novel views of a 3D scene with quality that fools the human eye. Yet, generating these images is very computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a technique based on spatial decomposition capable of mitigating this issue. Our key observation is that there are diminishing returns in employing larger (deeper and/or wider) networks. Hence, we propose to spatially decompose a scene and dedicate smaller networks for each decomposed part. When working together, these networks can render the whole scene. This allows us near-constant inference time regardless of the number of decomposed parts. Moreover, we show that a Voronoi spatial decomposition is preferable for this purpose, as it is provably compatible with the Painter's Algorithm for efficient and GPU-friendly rendering. Our experiments show that for real-world scenes, our method provides up to 3x more efficient inference than NeRF (with the same rendering quality), or an improvement of up to 1.0~dB in PSNR (for the same inference cost).
  - [DONeRF: Towards Real-Time Rendering of Compact Neural Radiance Fields using Depth Oracle Networks, CGF2021](https://depthoraclenerf.github.io/) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DONERF)
    > The recent research explosion around Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) shows that there is immense potential for implicitly storing scene and lighting information in neural networks, e.g., for novel view generation. However, one major limitation preventing the widespread use of NeRFs is the prohibitive computational cost of excessive network evaluations along each view ray, requiring dozens of petaFLOPS when aiming for real-time rendering on current devices. We show that the number of samples required for each view ray can be significantly reduced when local samples are placed around surfaces in the scene. To this end, we propose a depth oracle network, which predicts ray sample locations for each view ray with a single network evaluation. We show that using a classification network around logarithmically discretized and spherically warped depth values is essential to encode surface locations rather than directly estimating depth. The combination of these techniques leads to DONeRF, a dual network design with a depth oracle network as a first step and a locally sampled shading network for ray accumulation. With our design, we reduce the inference costs by up to 48x compared to NeRF. Using an off-the-shelf inference API in combination with simple compute kernels, we are the first to render raymarching-based neural representations at interactive frame rates (15 frames per second at 800x800) on a single GPU. At the same time, since we focus on the important parts of the scene around surfaces, we achieve equal or better quality compared to NeRF.
  - [FastNeRF: High-Fidelity Neural Rendering at 200FPS, ICCV2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10380) | [code]
    > Recent work on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) showed how neural networks can be used to encode complex 3D environments that can be rendered photorealistically from novel viewpoints. Rendering these images is very computationally demanding and recent improvements are still a long way from enabling interactive rates, even on high-end hardware. Motivated by scenarios on mobile and mixed reality devices, we propose FastNeRF, the first NeRF-based system capable of rendering high fidelity photorealistic images at 200Hz on a high-end consumer GPU. The core of our method is a graphics-inspired factorization that allows for (i) compactly caching a deep radiance map at each position in space, (ii) efficiently querying that map using ray directions to estimate the pixel values in the rendered image. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method is 3000 times faster than the original NeRF algorithm and at least an order of magnitude faster than existing work on accelerating NeRF, while maintaining visual quality and extensibility.
  - [KiloNeRF: Speeding up Neural Radiance Fields with Thousands of Tiny MLPsÂ , ICCV2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13744) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/creiser/kilonerf/)
    > NeRF synthesizes novel views of a scene with unprecedented quality by fitting a neural radiance field to RGB images. However, NeRF requires querying a deep Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) millions of times, leading to slow rendering times, even on modern GPUs. In this paper, we demonstrate that real-time rendering is possible by utilizing thousands of tiny MLPs instead of one single large MLP. In our setting, each individual MLP only needs to represent parts of the scene, thus smaller and faster-to-evaluate MLPs can be used. By combining this divide-and-conquer strategy with further optimizations, rendering is accelerated by three orders of magnitude compared to the original NeRF model without incurring high storage costs. Further, using teacher-student distillation for training, we show that this speed-up can be achieved without sacrificing visual quality.
  - [PlenOctrees for Real-time Rendering of Neural Radiance Fields, ICCV2021(oral)](https://alexyu.net/plenoctrees/) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/sxyu/volrend)
    > Real-time performance is achieved by pre-tabulating the NeRF into an octree-based radiance field that we call PlenOctrees. In order to preserve view-dependent effects such as specularities, we propose to encode appearances via closed-form spherical basis functions. Specifically, we show that it is possible to train NeRFs to predict a spherical harmonic representation of radiance, removing the viewing direction as input to the neural network. Furthermore, we show that our PlenOctrees can be directly optimized to further minimize the reconstruction loss, which leads to equal or better quality than competing methods. We further show that this octree optimization step can be used to accelerate the training time, as we no longer need to wait for the NeRF training to converge fully. Our real-time neural rendering approach may potentially enable new applications such as 6-DOF industrial and product visualizations, as well as next generation AR/VR systems.
  - [Mixture of Volumetric Primitives for Efficient Neural Rendering, SIGGRAPH2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01954) | [code]
    > Real-time rendering and animation of humans is a core function in games, movies, and telepresence applications. Existing methods have a number of drawbacks we aim to address with our work. Triangle meshes have difficulty modeling thin structures like hair, volumetric representations like Neural Volumes are too low-resolution given a reasonable memory budget, and high-resolution implicit representations like Neural Radiance Fields are too slow for use in real-time applications. We present Mixture of Volumetric Primitives (MVP), a representation for rendering dynamic 3D content that combines the completeness of volumetric representations with the efficiency of primitive-based rendering, e.g., point-based or mesh-based methods. Our approach achieves this by leveraging spatially shared computation with a deconvolutional architecture and by minimizing computation in empty regions of space with volumetric primitives that can move to cover only occupied regions. Our parameterization supports the integration of correspondence and tracking constraints, while being robust to areas where classical tracking fails, such as around thin or translucent structures and areas with large topological variability. MVP is a hybrid that generalizes both volumetric and primitive-based representations. Through a series of extensive experiments we demonstrate that it inherits the strengths of each, while avoiding many of their limitations. We also compare our approach to several state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate that MVP produces superior results in terms of quality and runtime performance.
  - [Light Field Networks: Neural Scene Representations with Single-Evaluation Rendering, NeurIPS2021(spotlight)](https://www.vincentsitzmann.com/lfns/) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/vsitzmann/light-field-networks)
    > Inferring representations of 3D scenes from 2D observations is a fundamental problem of computer graphics, computer vision, and artificial intelligence. Emerging 3D-structured neural scene representations are a promising approach to 3D scene understanding. In this work, we propose a novel neural scene representation, Light Field Networks or LFNs, which represent both geometry and appearance of the underlying 3D scene in a 360-degree, four-dimensional light field parameterized via a neural implicit representation. Rendering a ray from an LFN requires only a *single* network evaluation, as opposed to hundreds of evaluations per ray for ray-marching or volumetric based renderers in 3D-structured neural scene representations. In the setting of simple scenes, we leverage meta-learning to learn a prior over LFNs that enables multi-view consistent light field reconstruction from as little as a single image observation. This results in dramatic reductions in time and memory complexity, and enables real-time rendering. The cost of storing a 360-degree light field via an LFN is two orders of magnitude lower than conventional methods such as the Lumigraph. Utilizing the analytical differentiability of neural implicit representations and a novel parameterization of light space, we further demonstrate the extraction of sparse depth maps from LFNs.
  - [Depth-supervised NeRF: Fewer Views and Faster Training for Free, CVPR2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02791) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/dunbar12138/DSNeRF)
    > A commonly observed failure mode of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is fitting incorrect geometries when given an insufficient number of input views. One potential reason is that standard volumetric rendering does not enforce the constraint that most of a scene's geometry consist of empty space and opaque surfaces. We formalize the above assumption through DS-NeRF (Depth-supervised Neural Radiance Fields), a loss for learning radiance fields that takes advantage of readily-available depth supervision. We leverage the fact that current NeRF pipelines require images with known camera poses that are typically estimated by running structure-from-motion (SFM). Crucially, SFM also produces sparse 3D points that can be used as "free" depth supervision during training: we add a loss to encourage the distribution of a ray's terminating depth matches a given 3D keypoint, incorporating depth uncertainty. DS-NeRF can render better images given fewer training views while training 2-3x faster. Further, we show that our loss is compatible with other recently proposed NeRF methods, demonstrating that depth is a cheap and easily digestible supervisory signal. And finally, we find that DS-NeRF can support other types of depth supervision such as scanned depth sensors and RGB-D reconstruction outputs.
  - [Direct Voxel Grid Optimization: Super-fast Convergence for Radiance Fields Reconstruction, CVPR2022(oral)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11215) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/sunset1995/DirectVoxGO)
    > We present a super-fast convergence approach to reconstructing the per-scene radiance field from a set of images that capture the scene with known poses. This task, which is often applied to novel view synthesis, is recently revolutionized by Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) for its state-of-the-art quality and flexibility. However, NeRF and its variants require a lengthy training time ranging from hours to days for a single scene. In contrast, our approach achieves NeRF-comparable quality and converges rapidly from scratch in less than 15 minutes with a single GPU. We adopt a representation consisting of a density voxel grid for scene geometry and a feature voxel grid with a shallow network for complex view-dependent appearance. Modeling with explicit and discretized volume representations is not new, but we propose two simple yet non-trivial techniques that contribute to fast convergence speed and high-quality output. First, we introduce the post-activation interpolation on voxel density, which is capable of producing sharp surfaces in lower grid resolution. Second, direct voxel density optimization is prone to suboptimal geometry solutions, so we robustify the optimization process by imposing several priors. Finally, evaluation on five inward-facing benchmarks shows that our method matches, if not surpasses, NeRF's quality, yet it only takes about 15 minutes to train from scratch for a new scene.

    > We show for the first time that a multilayer perceptron (MLP) can serve as the only scene representation in a real-time SLAM system for a handheld RGB-D camera. Our network is trained in live operation without prior data, building a dense, scene-specific implicit 3D model of occupancy and colour which is also immediately used for tracking.
  - [Mip-NeRF: A Multiscale Representation for Anti-Aliasing Neural Radiance Fields, ICCV2021(oral)](https://jonbarron.info/mipnerf/) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/google/mipnerf)
    > The rendering procedure used by neural radiance fields (NeRF) samples a scene with a single ray per pixel and may therefore produce renderings that are excessively blurred or aliased when training or testing images observe scene content at different resolutions. The straightforward solution of supersampling by rendering with multiple rays per pixel is impractical for NeRF, because rendering each ray requires querying a multilayer perceptron hundreds of times. Our solution, which we call "mip-NeRF" (Ã  la "mipmap"), extends NeRF to represent the scene at a continuously-valued scale. By efficiently rendering anti-aliased conical frustums instead of rays, mip-NeRF reduces objectionable aliasing artifacts and significantly improves NeRF's ability to represent fine details, while also being 7% faster than NeRF and half the size. Compared to NeRF, mip-NeRF reduces average error rates by 17% on the dataset presented with NeRF and by 60% on a challenging multiscale variant of that dataset that we present. mip-NeRF is also able to match the accuracy of a brute-force supersampled NeRF on our multiscale dataset while being 22x faster.
