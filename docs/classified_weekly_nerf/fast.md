  - [End-to-end learning of 3D phase-only holograms for holographic display](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41377-022-00894-6) | [code]
    > Computer-generated holography (CGH) provides volumetric control of coherent wavefront and is fundamental to applications such as volumetric 3D displays, lithography, neural photostimulation, and optical/acoustic trapping. Recently, deep learning-based methods emerged as promising computational paradigms for CGH synthesis that overcome the quality-runtime tradeoff in conventional simulation/optimization-based methods. Yet, the quality of the predicted hologram is intrinsically bounded by the datasetâ€™s quality. Here we introduce a new hologram dataset, MIT-CGH-4K-V2, that uses a layered depth image as a data-efficient volumetric 3D input and a two-stage supervised+unsupervised training protocol for direct synthesis of high-quality 3D phase-only holograms. The proposed system also corrects vision aberration, allowing customization for end-users. We experimentally show photorealistic 3D holographic projections and discuss relevant spatial light modulator calibration procedures. Our method runs in real-time on a consumer GPU and 5 FPS on an iPhone 13 Pro, promising drastically enhanced performance for the applications above.

  - [MobileNeRF: Exploiting the Polygon Rasterization Pipeline for Efficient Neural Field Rendering on Mobile Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00277) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/google-research/jax3d/tree/main/jax3d/projects/mobilenerf)
    > Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated amazing ability to synthesize images of 3D scenes from novel views. However, they rely upon specialized volumetric rendering algorithms based on ray marching that are mismatched to the capabilities of widely deployed graphics hardware. This paper introduces a new NeRF representation based on textured polygons that can synthesize novel images efficiently with standard rendering pipelines. The NeRF is represented as a set of polygons with textures representing binary opacities and feature vectors. Traditional rendering of the polygons with a z-buffer yields an image with features at every pixel, which are interpreted by a small, view-dependent MLP running in a fragment shader to produce a final pixel color. This approach enables NeRFs to be rendered with the traditional polygon rasterization pipeline, which provides massive pixel-level parallelism, achieving interactive frame rates on a wide range of compute platforms, including mobile phones.
  - [End-to-end View Synthesis via NeRF Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14741) | [code]
    > In this paper, we present a simple seq2seq formulation for view synthesis where we take a set of ray points as input and output colors corresponding to the rays. Directly applying a standard transformer on this seq2seq formulation has two limitations. First, the standard attention cannot successfully fit the volumetric rendering procedure, and therefore high-frequency components are missing in the synthesized views. Second, applying global attention to all rays and pixels is extremely inefficient. Inspired by the neural radiance field (NeRF), we propose the NeRF attention (NeRFA) to address the above problems. On the one hand, NeRFA considers the volumetric rendering equation as a soft feature modulation procedure. In this way, the feature modulation enhances the transformers with the NeRF-like inductive bias. On the other hand, NeRFA performs multi-stage attention to reduce the computational overhead. Furthermore, the NeRFA model adopts the ray and pixel transformers to learn the interactions between rays and pixels. NeRFA demonstrates superior performance over NeRF and NerFormer on four datasets: DeepVoxels, Blender, LLFF, and CO3D. Besides, NeRFA establishes a new state-of-the-art under two settings: the single-scene view synthesis and the category-centric novel view synthesis. The code will be made publicly available.
  - [Going Off-Grid: Continuous Implicit Neural Representations for 3D Vascular Modeling, MICCAI STACOM 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14663) | [code]
    > Personalised 3D vascular models are valuable for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment planning in patients with cardiovascular disease. Traditionally, such models have been constructed with explicit representations such as meshes and voxel masks, or implicit representations such as radial basis functions or atomic (tubular) shapes. Here, we propose to represent surfaces by the zero level set of their signed distance function (SDF) in a differentiable implicit neural representation (INR). This allows us to model complex vascular structures with a representation that is implicit, continuous, light-weight, and easy to integrate with deep learning algorithms. We here demonstrate the potential of this approach with three practical examples. First, we obtain an accurate and watertight surface for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) from CT images and show robust fitting from as little as 200 points on the surface. Second, we simultaneously fit nested vessel walls in a single INR without intersections. Third, we show how 3D models of individual arteries can be smoothly blended into a single watertight surface. Our results show that INRs are a flexible representation with potential for minimally interactive annotation and manipulation of complex vascular structures.
