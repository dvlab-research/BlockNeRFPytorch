  - [PRIF: Primary Ray-based Implicit Function](https://research.google/pubs/pub51556/) | [code]
    > We introduce a new implicit shape representation called Primary Ray-based Implicit Function (PRIF). In contrast to most existing approaches based on the signed distance function (SDF) which handles spatial locations, our representation operates on oriented rays. Specifically, PRIF is formulated to directly produce the surface hit point of a given input ray, without the expensive sphere-tracing operations, hence enabling efficient shape extraction and differentiable rendering. We demonstrate that neural networks trained to encode PRIF achieve successes in various tasks including single shape representation, category-wise shape generation, shape completion from sparse or noisy observations, inverse rendering for camera pose estimation, and neural rendering with color.

  - [Going Off-Grid: Continuous Implicit Neural Representations for 3D Vascular Modeling, MICCAI STACOM 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14663) | [code]
    > Personalised 3D vascular models are valuable for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment planning in patients with cardiovascular disease. Traditionally, such models have been constructed with explicit representations such as meshes and voxel masks, or implicit representations such as radial basis functions or atomic (tubular) shapes. Here, we propose to represent surfaces by the zero level set of their signed distance function (SDF) in a differentiable implicit neural representation (INR). This allows us to model complex vascular structures with a representation that is implicit, continuous, light-weight, and easy to integrate with deep learning algorithms. We here demonstrate the potential of this approach with three practical examples. First, we obtain an accurate and watertight surface for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) from CT images and show robust fitting from as little as 200 points on the surface. Second, we simultaneously fit nested vessel walls in a single INR without intersections. Third, we show how 3D models of individual arteries can be smoothly blended into a single watertight surface. Our results show that INRs are a flexible representation with potential for minimally interactive annotation and manipulation of complex vascular structures.
  - [GAUDI: A Neural Architect for Immersive 3D Scene Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13751) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/apple/ml-gaudi)
    > We introduce GAUDI, a generative model capable of capturing the distribution of complex and realistic 3D scenes that can be rendered immersively from a moving camera. We tackle this challenging problem with a scalable yet powerful approach, where we first optimize a latent representation that disentangles radiance fields and camera poses. This latent representation is then used to learn a generative model that enables both unconditional and conditional generation of 3D scenes. Our model generalizes previous works that focus on single objects by removing the assumption that the camera pose distribution can be shared across samples. We show that GAUDI obtains state-of-the-art performance in the unconditional generative setting across multiple datasets and allows for conditional generation of 3D scenes given conditioning variables like sparse image observations or text that describes the scene.
  - [AlignSDF: Pose-Aligned Signed Distance Fields for Hand-Object Reconstruction, ECCV2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12909) | [***``[code]``***](https://zerchen.github.io/projects/alignsdf.html)
    > Recent work achieved impressive progress towards joint reconstruction of hands and manipulated objects from monocular color images. Existing methods focus on two alternative representations in terms of either parametric meshes or signed distance fields (SDFs). On one side, parametric models can benefit from prior knowledge at the cost of limited shape deformations and mesh resolutions. Mesh models, hence, may fail to precisely reconstruct details such as contact surfaces of hands and objects. SDF-based methods, on the other side, can represent arbitrary details but are lacking explicit priors. In this work we aim to improve SDF models using priors provided by parametric representations. In particular, we propose a joint learning framework that disentangles the pose and the shape. We obtain hand and object poses from parametric models and use them to align SDFs in 3D space. We show that such aligned SDFs better focus on reconstructing shape details and improve reconstruction accuracy both for hands and objects. We evaluate our method and demonstrate significant improvements over the state of the art on the challenging ObMan and DexYCB benchmarks.
  - [NeuMesh: Learning Disentangled Neural Mesh-based Implicit Field for Geometry and Texture Editing, ECCV2022 (Oral)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11911) | [code]
    > Very recently neural implicit rendering techniques have been rapidly evolved and shown great advantages in novel view synthesis and 3D scene reconstruction. However, existing neural rendering methods for editing purposes offer limited functionality, e.g., rigid transformation, or not applicable for fine-grained editing for general objects from daily lives. In this paper, we present a novel mesh-based representation by encoding the neural implicit field with disentangled geometry and texture codes on mesh vertices, which facilitates a set of editing functionalities, including mesh-guided geometry editing, designated texture editing with texture swapping, filling and painting operations. To this end, we develop several techniques including learnable sign indicators to magnify spatial distinguishability of mesh-based representation, distillation and fine-tuning mechanism to make a steady convergence, and the spatial-aware optimization strategy to realize precise texture editing. Extensive experiments and editing examples on both real and synthetic data demonstrate the superiority of our method on representation quality and editing ability.
