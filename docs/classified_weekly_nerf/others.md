  - [Dfferentiable Raycasting for Self-supervised Occupancy Forecasting, ECCV2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01917) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/tarashakhurana/emergent-occ-forecasting)
    > Motion planning for safe autonomous driving requires learning how the environment around an ego-vehicle evolves with time. Ego-centric perception of driveable regions in a scene not only changes with the motion of actors in the environment, but also with the movement of the ego-vehicle itself. Self-supervised representations proposed for large-scale planning, such as ego-centric freespace, confound these two motions, making the representation difficult to use for downstream motion planners. In this paper, we use geometric occupancy as a natural alternative to view-dependent representations such as freespace. Occupancy maps naturally disentangle the motion of the environment from the motion of the ego-vehicle. However, one cannot directly observe the full 3D occupancy of a scene (due to occlusion), making it difficult to use as a signal for learning. Our key insight is to use differentiable raycasting to "render" future occupancy predictions into future LiDAR sweep predictions, which can be compared with ground-truth sweeps for self-supervised learning. The use of differentiable raycasting allows occupancy to emerge as an internal representation within the forecasting network. In the absence of groundtruth occupancy, we quantitatively evaluate the forecasting of raycasted LiDAR sweeps and show improvements of upto 15 F1 points. For downstream motion planners, where emergent occupancy can be directly used to guide non-driveable regions, this representation relatively reduces the number of collisions with objects by up to 17% as compared to freespace-centric motion planners.
  - [Self-improving Multiplane-to-layer Images for Novel View Synthesis, WACV2023](https://samsunglabs.github.io/MLI/) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/SamsungLabs/MLI)
    > We present a new method for lightweight novel-view synthesis that generalizes to an arbitrary forward-facing scene. Recent approaches are computationally expensive, require per-scene optimization, or produce a memory-expensive representation. We start by representing the scene with a set of fronto-parallel semitransparent planes and afterward convert them to deformable layers in an end-to-end manner. Additionally, we employ a feed-forward refinement procedure that corrects the estimated representation by aggregating information from input views. Our method does not require fine-tuning when a new scene is processed and can handle an arbitrary number of views without restrictions. Experimental results show that our approach surpasses recent models in terms of common metrics and human evaluation, with the noticeable advantage in inference speed and compactness of the inferred layered geometry, see this https URL
  - [NARF22: Neural Articulated Radiance Fields for Configuration-Aware Rendering, IROS2022](https://progress.eecs.umich.edu/projects/narf/) | [code]
    > Articulated objects pose a unique challenge for robotic perception and manipulation. Their increased number of degrees-of-freedom makes tasks such as localization computationally difficult, while also making the process of real-world dataset collection unscalable. With the aim of addressing these scalability issues, we propose Neural Articulated Radiance Fields (NARF22), a pipeline which uses a fully-differentiable, configuration-parameterized Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) as a means of providing high quality renderings of articulated objects. NARF22 requires no explicit knowledge of the object structure at inference time. We propose a two-stage parts-based training mechanism which allows the object rendering models to generalize well across the configuration space even if the underlying training data has as few as one configuration represented. We demonstrate the efficacy of NARF22 by training configurable renderers on a real-world articulated tool dataset collected via a Fetch mobile manipulation robot. We show the applicability of the model to gradient-based inference methods through a configuration estimation and 6 degree-of-freedom pose refinement task.

  - [SinGRAV: Learning a Generative Radiance Volume from a Single Natural Scene](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01202) | [code]
    > We present a 3D generative model for general natural scenes. Lacking necessary volumes of 3D data characterizing the target scene, we propose to learn from a single scene. Our key insight is that a natural scene often contains multiple constituents whose geometry, texture, and spatial arrangements follow some clear patterns, but still exhibit rich variations over different regions within the same scene. This suggests localizing the learning of a generative model on substantial local regions. Hence, we exploit a multi-scale convolutional network, which possesses the spatial locality bias in nature, to learn from the statistics of local regions at multiple scales within a single scene. In contrast to existing methods, our learning setup bypasses the need to collect data from many homogeneous 3D scenes for learning common features. We coin our method SinGRAV, for learning a Generative RAdiance Volume from a Single natural scene. We demonstrate the ability of SinGRAV in generating plausible and diverse variations from a single scene, the merits of SinGRAV over state-of-the-art generative neural scene methods, as well as the versatility of SinGRAV by its use in a variety of applications, spanning 3D scene editing, composition, and animation. Code and data will be released to facilitate further research.
  - [IntrinsicNeRF: Learning Intrinsic Neural Radiance Fields for Editable Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00647) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/zju3dv/IntrinsicNeRF)
    > We present intrinsic neural radiance fields, dubbed IntrinsicNeRF, that introduce intrinsic decomposition into the NeRF-based~\cite{mildenhall2020nerf} neural rendering method and can perform editable novel view synthesis in room-scale scenes while existing inverse rendering combined with neural rendering methods~\cite{zhang2021physg, zhang2022modeling} can only work on object-specific scenes. Given that intrinsic decomposition is a fundamentally ambiguous and under-constrained inverse problem, we propose a novel distance-aware point sampling and adaptive reflectance iterative clustering optimization method that enables IntrinsicNeRF with traditional intrinsic decomposition constraints to be trained in an unsupervised manner, resulting in temporally consistent intrinsic decomposition results. To cope with the problem of different adjacent instances of similar reflectance in a scene being incorrectly clustered together, we further propose a hierarchical clustering method with coarse-to-fine optimization to obtain a fast hierarchical indexing representation. It enables compelling real-time augmented reality applications such as scene recoloring, material editing, and illumination variation. Extensive experiments on Blender Object and Replica Scene demonstrate that we can obtain high-quality, consistent intrinsic decomposition results and high-fidelity novel view synthesis even for challenging sequences.

  - [SCI: A spectrum concentrated implicit neural compression for biomedical data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15180) | [code]
    > Massive collection and explosive growth of the huge amount of medical data, demands effective compression for efficient storage, transmission and sharing. Readily available visual data compression techniques have been studied extensively but tailored for nature images/videos, and thus show limited performance on medical data which are of different characteristics. Emerging implicit neural representation (INR) is gaining momentum and demonstrates high promise for fitting diverse visual data in target-data-specific manner, but a general compression scheme covering diverse medical data is so far absent. To address this issue, we firstly derive a mathematical explanation for INR's spectrum concentration property and an analytical insight on the design of compression-oriented INR architecture. Further, we design a funnel shaped neural network capable of covering broad spectrum of complex medical data and achieving high compression ratio. Based on this design, we conduct compression via optimization under given budget and propose an adaptive compression approach SCI, which adaptively partitions the target data into blocks matching the concentrated spectrum envelop of the adopted INR, and allocates parameter with high representation accuracy under given compression ratio. The experiments show SCI's superior performance over conventional techniques and wide applicability across diverse medical data.
  - [Distilling Style from Image Pairs for Global Forward and Inverse Tone Mapping, CVMP2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15165) | [code]
    > Many image enhancement or editing operations, such as forward and inverse tone mapping or color grading, do not have a unique solution, but instead a range of solutions, each representing a different style. Despite this, existing learning-based methods attempt to learn a unique mapping, disregarding this style. In this work, we show that information about the style can be distilled from collections of image pairs and encoded into a 2- or 3-dimensional vector. This gives us not only an efficient representation but also an interpretable latent space for editing the image style. We represent the global color mapping between a pair of images as a custom normalizing flow, conditioned on a polynomial basis of the pixel color. We show that such a network is more effective than PCA or VAE at encoding image style in low-dimensional space and lets us obtain an accuracy close to 40 dB, which is about 7-10 dB improvement over the state-of-the-art methods.
  - [Towards Multi-spatiotemporal-scale Generalized PDE Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15616) | [code]
    > Partial differential equations (PDEs) are central to describing complex physical system simulations. Their expensive solution techniques have led to an increased interest in deep neural network based surrogates. However, the practical utility of training such surrogates is contingent on their ability to model complex multi-scale spatio-temporal phenomena. Various neural network architectures have been proposed to target such phenomena, most notably Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) which give a natural handle over local \& global spatial information via parameterization of different Fourier modes, and U-Nets which treat local and global information via downsampling and upsampling paths. However, generalizing across different equation parameters or different time-scales still remains a challenge. In this work, we make a comprehensive comparison between various FNO and U-Net like approaches on fluid mechanics problems in both vorticity-stream and velocity function form. For U-Nets, we transfer recent architectural improvements from computer vision, most notably from object segmentation and generative modeling. We further analyze the design considerations for using FNO layers to improve performance of U-Net architectures without major degradation of computational performance. Finally, we show promising results on generalization to different PDE parameters and time-scales with a single surrogate model.
  - [Implicit Neural Spatial Representations for Time-dependent PDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00124) | [code]
    > Numerically solving partial differential equations (PDEs) often entails spatial and temporal discretizations. Traditional methods (e.g., finite difference, finite element, smoothed-particle hydrodynamics) frequently adopt explicit spatial discretizations, such as grids, meshes, and point clouds, where each degree-of-freedom corresponds to a location in space. While these explicit spatial correspondences are intuitive to model and understand, these representations are not necessarily optimal for accuracy, memory-usage, or adaptivity. In this work, we explore implicit neural representation as an alternative spatial discretization, where spatial information is implicitly stored in the neural network weights. With implicit neural spatial representation, PDE-constrained time-stepping translates into updating neural network weights, which naturally integrates with commonly adopted optimization time integrators. We validate our approach on a variety of classic PDEs with examples involving large elastic deformations, turbulent fluids, and multiscale phenomena. While slower to compute than traditional representations, our approach exhibits higher accuracy, lower memory consumption, and dynamically adaptive allocation of degrees of freedom without complex remeshing.
  - [Continuous PDE Dynamics Forecasting with Implicit Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14855) | [code]
    > Effective data-driven PDE forecasting methods often rely on fixed spatial and / or temporal discretizations. This raises limitations in real-world applications like weather prediction where flexible extrapolation at arbitrary spatiotemporal locations is required. We address this problem by introducing a new data-driven approach, DINo, that models a PDE's flow with continuous-time dynamics of spatially continuous functions. This is achieved by embedding spatial observations independently of their discretization via Implicit Neural Representations in a small latent space temporally driven by a learned ODE. This separate and flexible treatment of time and space makes DINo the first data-driven model to combine the following advantages. It extrapolates at arbitrary spatial and temporal locations; it can learn from sparse irregular grids or manifolds; at test time, it generalizes to new grids or resolutions. DINo outperforms alternative neural PDE forecasters in a variety of challenging generalization scenarios on representative PDE systems.
  - [Towards General-Purpose Representation Learning of Polygonal Geometries, GeoInformatica](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15458) | [code]
    > Neural network representation learning for spatial data is a common need for geographic artificial intelligence (GeoAI) problems. In recent years, many advancements have been made in representation learning for points, polylines, and networks, whereas little progress has been made for polygons, especially complex polygonal geometries. In this work, we focus on developing a general-purpose polygon encoding model, which can encode a polygonal geometry (with or without holes, single or multipolygons) into an embedding space. The result embeddings can be leveraged directly (or finetuned) for downstream tasks such as shape classification, spatial relation prediction, and so on. To achieve model generalizability guarantees, we identify a few desirable properties: loop origin invariance, trivial vertex invariance, part permutation invariance, and topology awareness. We explore two different designs for the encoder: one derives all representations in the spatial domain; the other leverages spectral domain representations. For the spatial domain approach, we propose ResNet1D, a 1D CNN-based polygon encoder, which uses circular padding to achieve loop origin invariance on simple polygons. For the spectral domain approach, we develop NUFTspec based on Non-Uniform Fourier Transformation (NUFT), which naturally satisfies all the desired properties. We conduct experiments on two tasks: 1) shape classification based on MNIST; 2) spatial relation prediction based on two new datasets - DBSR-46K and DBSR-cplx46K. Our results show that NUFTspec and ResNet1D outperform multiple existing baselines with significant margins. While ResNet1D suffers from model performance degradation after shape-invariance geometry modifications, NUFTspec is very robust to these modifications due to the nature of the NUFT.
  - [Enforcing safety for vision-based controllers via Control Barrier Functions and Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12266) | [code]
    > To navigate complex environments, robots must increasingly use high-dimensional visual feedback (e.g. images) for control. However, relying on high-dimensional image data to make control decisions raises important questions; particularly, how might we prove the safety of a visual-feedback controller? Control barrier functions (CBFs) are powerful tools for certifying the safety of feedback controllers in the state-feedback setting, but CBFs have traditionally been poorly-suited to visual feedback control due to the need to predict future observations in order to evaluate the barrier function. In this work, we solve this issue by leveraging recent advances in neural radiance fields (NeRFs), which learn implicit representations of 3D scenes and can render images from previously-unseen camera perspectives, to provide single-step visual foresight for a CBF-based controller. This novel combination is able to filter out unsafe actions and intervene to preserve safety. We demonstrate the effect of our controller in real-time simulation experiments where it successfully prevents the robot from taking dangerous actions.
  - [WaterNeRF: Neural Radiance Fields for Underwater Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13091) | [code]
    > Underwater imaging is a critical task performed by marine robots for a wide range of applications including aquaculture, marine infrastructure inspection, and environmental monitoring. However, water column effects, such as attenuation and backscattering, drastically change the color and quality of imagery captured underwater. Due to varying water conditions and range-dependency of these effects, restoring underwater imagery is a challenging problem. This impacts downstream perception tasks including depth estimation and 3D reconstruction. In this paper, we advance state-of-the-art in neural radiance fields (NeRFs) to enable physics-informed dense depth estimation and color correction. Our proposed method, WaterNeRF, estimates parameters of a physics-based model for underwater image formation, leading to a hybrid data-driven and model-based solution. After determining the scene structure and radiance field, we can produce novel views of degraded as well as corrected underwater images, along with dense depth of the scene. We evaluate the proposed method qualitatively and quantitatively on a real underwater dataset.

  - [How Does It Feel? Self-Supervised Costmap Learning for Off-Road Vehicle Traversability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10788) | [code]
    > Estimating terrain traversability in off-road environments requires reasoning about complex interaction dynamics between the robot and these terrains. However, it is challenging to build an accurate physics model, or create informative labels to learn a model in a supervised manner, for these interactions. We propose a method that learns to predict traversability costmaps by combining exteroceptive environmental information with proprioceptive terrain interaction feedback in a self-supervised manner. Additionally, we propose a novel way of incorporating robot velocity in the costmap prediction pipeline. We validate our method in multiple short and large-scale navigation tasks on a large, autonomous all-terrain vehicle (ATV) on challenging off-road terrains, and demonstrate ease of integration on a separate large ground robot. Our short-scale navigation results show that using our learned costmaps leads to overall smoother navigation, and provides the robot with a more fine-grained understanding of the interactions between the robot and different terrain types, such as grass and gravel. Our large-scale navigation trials show that we can reduce the number of interventions by up to 57% compared to an occupancy-based navigation baseline in challenging off-road courses ranging from 400 m to 3150 m.
  - [wildNeRF: Complete view synthesis of in-the-wild dynamic scenes captured using sparse monocular data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10399) | [code]
    > We present a novel neural radiance model that is trainable in a self-supervised manner for novel-view synthesis of dynamic unstructured scenes. Our end-to-end trainable algorithm learns highly complex, real-world static scenes within seconds and dynamic scenes with both rigid and non-rigid motion within minutes. By differentiating between static and motion-centric pixels, we create high-quality representations from a sparse set of images. We perform extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation on existing benchmarks and set the state-of-the-art on performance measures on the challenging NVIDIA Dynamic Scenes Dataset. Additionally, we evaluate our model performance on challenging real-world datasets such as Cholec80 and SurgicalActions160.
  - [Density-aware NeRF Ensembles: Quantifying Predictive Uncertainty in Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08718) | [code]
    > We show that ensembling effectively quantifies model uncertainty in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) if a density-aware epistemic uncertainty term is considered. The naive ensembles investigated in prior work simply average rendered RGB images to quantify the model uncertainty caused by conflicting explanations of the observed scene. In contrast, we additionally consider the termination probabilities along individual rays to identify epistemic model uncertainty due to a lack of knowledge about the parts of a scene unobserved during training. We achieve new state-of-the-art performance across established uncertainty quantification benchmarks for NeRFs, outperforming methods that require complex changes to the NeRF architecture and training regime. We furthermore demonstrate that NeRF uncertainty can be utilised for next-best view selection and model refinement.
  - [LATITUDE: Robotic Global Localization with Truncated Dynamic Low-pass Filter in City-scale NeRF, ICRA2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08498) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/jike5/LATITUDE)
    > Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have made great success in representing complex 3D scenes with high-resolution details and efficient memory. Nevertheless, current NeRF-based pose estimators have no initial pose prediction and are prone to local optima during optimization. In this paper, we present LATITUDE: Global Localization with Truncated Dynamic Low-pass Filter, which introduces a two-stage localization mechanism in city-scale NeRF. In place recognition stage, we train a regressor through images generated from trained NeRFs, which provides an initial value for global localization. In pose optimization stage, we minimize the residual between the observed image and rendered image by directly optimizing the pose on tangent plane. To avoid convergence to local optimum, we introduce a Truncated Dynamic Low-pass Filter (TDLF) for coarse-to-fine pose registration. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real-world data and show its potential applications for high-precision navigation in large-scale city scenes. Codes and data will be publicly available at this https URL.
  - [Implicit Neural Representations for Medical Imaging Segmentation, MICCAI2022](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-16443-9_42) | [code]
    > 3D signals in medical imaging, such as CT scans, are usually parameterized as a discrete grid of voxels. For instance, existing state-of-the-art organ segmentation methods learn discrete segmentation maps. Unfortunately, the memory requirements of such methods grow cubically with increasing spatial resolution, which makes them unsuitable for processing high resolution scans. To overcome this, we design an Implicit Organ Segmentation Network (IOSNet) that utilizes continuous Implicit Neural Representations and has several useful properties. Firstly, the IOSNet decoder memory is roughly constant and independent of the spatial resolution since it parameterizes the segmentation map as a continuous function. Secondly, IOSNet converges much faster than discrete voxel based methods due to its ability to accurately segment organs irrespective of organ sizes, thereby alleviating size imbalance issues without requiring any auxiliary tricks. Thirdly, IOSNet naturally supports super-resolution (i.e. sampling at arbitrary resolutions during inference) due to its continuous learnt representations. Moreover, despite using a simple lightweight decoder, IOSNet consistently outperforms the discrete specialized segmentation architecture UNet. Hence, our approach demonstrates that Implicit Neural Representations are well-suited for medical imaging applications, especially for processing high-resolution 3D medical scans.

  - [DevNet: Self-supervised Monocular Depth Learning via Density Volume Construction, ECCV2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06351) | [code]
    > Self-supervised depth learning from monocular images normally relies on the 2D pixel-wise photometric relation between temporally adjacent image frames. However, they neither fully exploit the 3D point-wise geometric correspondences, nor effectively tackle the ambiguities in the photometric warping caused by occlusions or illumination inconsistency. To address these problems, this work proposes Density Volume Construction Network (DevNet), a novel self-supervised monocular depth learning framework, that can consider 3D spatial information, and exploit stronger geometric constraints among adjacent camera frustums. Instead of directly regressing the pixel value from a single image, our DevNet divides the camera frustum into multiple parallel planes and predicts the pointwise occlusion probability density on each plane. The final depth map is generated by integrating the density along corresponding rays. During the training process, novel regularization strategies and loss functions are introduced to mitigate photometric ambiguities and overfitting. Without obviously enlarging model parameters size or running time, DevNet outperforms several representative baselines on both the KITTI-2015 outdoor dataset and NYU-V2 indoor dataset. In particular, the root-mean-square-deviation is reduced by around 4% with DevNet on both KITTI-2015 and NYU-V2 in the task of depth estimation. Code is available at this https URL.
  - [Learning A Unified 3D Point Cloud for View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05013) | [code]
    > 3D point cloud representation-based view synthesis methods have demonstrated effectiveness. However, existing methods usually synthesize novel views only from a single source view, and it is non-trivial to generalize them to handle multiple source views for pursuing higher reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning-based view synthesis paradigm, which learns a unified 3D point cloud from different source views. Specifically, we first construct sub-point clouds by projecting source views to 3D space based on their depth maps. Then, we learn the unified 3D point cloud by adaptively fusing points at a local neighborhood defined on the union of the sub-point clouds. Besides, we also propose a 3D geometry-guided image restoration module to fill the holes and recover high-frequency details of the rendered novel views. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art view synthesis methods to a large extent both quantitatively and visually.
  - [Self-Supervised Coordinate Projection Network for Sparse-View Computed Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05483) | [code]
    > In the present work, we propose a Self-supervised COordinate Projection nEtwork (SCOPE) to reconstruct the artifacts-free CT image from a single SV sinogram by solving the inverse tomography imaging problem. Compared with recent related works that solve similar problems using implicit neural representation network (INR), our essential contribution is an effective and simple re-projection strategy that pushes the tomography image reconstruction quality over supervised deep learning CT reconstruction works. The proposed strategy is inspired by the simple relationship between linear algebra and inverse problems. To solve the under-determined linear equation system, we first introduce INR to constrain the solution space via image continuity prior and achieve a rough solution. And secondly, we propose to generate a dense view sinogram that improves the rank of the linear equation system and produces a more stable CT image solution space. Our experiment results demonstrate that the re-projection strategy significantly improves the image reconstruction quality (+3 dB for PSNR at least). Besides, we integrate the recent hash encoding into our SCOPE model, which greatly accelerates the model training. Finally, we evaluate SCOPE in parallel and fan X-ray beam SVCT reconstruction tasks. Experimental results indicate that the proposed SCOPE model outperforms two latest INR-based methods and two well-popular supervised DL methods quantitatively and qualitatively.
  - [CU-Net: Efficient Point Cloud Color Upsampling Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06112) | [code]
    > Point cloud upsampling is necessary for Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, and telepresence scenarios. Although the geometry upsampling is well studied to densify point cloud coordinates, the upsampling of colors has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we propose CU-Net, the first deep-learning point cloud color upsampling model. Leveraging a feature extractor based on sparse convolution and a color prediction module based on neural implicit function, CU-Net achieves linear time and space complexity. Therefore, CU-Net is theoretically guaranteed to be more efficient than most existing methods with quadratic complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that CU-Net can colorize a photo-realistic point cloud with nearly a million points in real time, while having better visual quality than baselines. Besides, CU-Net can adapt to an arbitrary upsampling ratio and unseen objects. Our source code will be released to the public soon.

    > The goal of this work is to perform 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis from data captured by scanning platforms commonly deployed for world mapping in urban outdoor environments (e.g., Street View). Given a sequence of posed RGB images and lidar sweeps acquired by cameras and scanners moving through an outdoor scene, we produce a model from which 3D surfaces can be extracted and novel RGB images can be synthesized. Our approach extends Neural Radiance Fields, which has been demonstrated to synthesize realistic novel images for small scenes in controlled settings, with new methods for leveraging asynchronously captured lidar data, for addressing exposure variation between captured images, and for leveraging predicted image segmentations to supervise densities on rays pointing at the sky. Each of these three extensions provides significant performance improvements in experiments on Street View data. Our system produces state-of-the-art 3D surface reconstructions and synthesizes higher quality novel views in comparison to both traditional methods (e.g.~COLMAP) and recent neural representations (e.g.~Mip-NeRF).

    > Full waveform inversion (FWI) commonly stands for the state-of-the-art approach for imaging subsurface structures and physical parameters, however, its implementation usually faces great challenges, such as building a good initial model to escape from local minima, and evaluating the uncertainty of inversion results. In this paper, we propose the implicit full waveform inversion (IFWI) algorithm using continuously and implicitly defined deep neural representations. Compared to FWI, which is sensitive to the initial model, IFWI benefits from the increased degrees of freedom with deep learning optimization, thus allowing to start from a random initialization, which greatly reduces the risk of non-uniqueness and being trapped in local minima. Both theoretical and experimental analyses indicates that, given a random initial model, IFWI is able to converge to the global minimum and produce a high-resolution image of subsurface with fine structures. In addition, uncertainty analysis of IFWI can be easily performed by approximating Bayesian inference with various deep learning approaches, which is analyzed in this paper by adding dropout neurons. Furthermore, IFWI has a certain degree of robustness and strong generalization ability that are exemplified in the experiments of various 2D geological models. With proper setup, IFWI can also be well suited for multi-scale joint geophysical inversion.

  - [FoV-NeRF: Foveated Neural Radiance Fields for Virtual Reality, TVCG2022](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9872532) | [code]
    > Virtual Reality (VR) is becoming ubiquitous with the rise of consumer displays and commercial VR platforms. Such displays require low latency and high quality rendering of synthetic imagery with reduced compute overheads. Recent advances in neural rendering showed promise of unlocking new possibilities in 3D computer graphics via image-based representations of virtual or physical environments. Specifically, the neural radiance fields (NeRF) demonstrated that photo-realistic quality and continuous view changes of 3D scenes can be achieved without loss of view-dependent effects. While NeRF can significantly benefit rendering for VR applications, it faces unique challenges posed by high field-of-view, high resolution, and stereoscopic/egocentric viewing, typically causing low quality and high latency of the rendered images. In VR, this not only harms the interaction experience but may also cause sickness. To tackle these problems toward six-degrees-of-freedom, egocentric, and stereo NeRF in VR, we present the first gaze-contingent 3D neural representation and view synthesis method . We incorporate the human psychophysics of visual- and stereo-acuity into an egocentric neural representation of 3D scenery. We then jointly optimize the latency/performance and visual quality while mutually bridging human perception and neural scene synthesis to achieve perceptually high-quality immersive interaction. We conducted both objective analysis and subjective studies to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. We find that our method significantly reduces latency (up to 99% time reduction compared with NeRF) without loss of high-fidelity rendering (perceptually identical to full-resolution ground truth). The presented approach may serve as the first step toward future VR/AR systems that capture, teleport, and visualize remote environments in real-time.

This is achieved by decoupling occupancy and color learning within the NeRF framework into separate Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) trained using LiDAR and camera data, respectively. In addition, this paper proposes a novel method to build differentiable 3D Occupancy Grid Maps (OGM) alongside the NeRF model, and leverage this occupancy grid for improved sampling of points along a ray for volumetric rendering in metric space.

    > Implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool that provides an accurate and resolution-independent encoding of data. Their robustness as general approximators has been shown in a wide variety of data sources, with applications on image, sound, and 3D scene representation. However, little attention has been given to leveraging these architectures for the representation and analysis of time series data. In this paper, we analyze the representation of time series using INRs, comparing different activation functions in terms of reconstruction accuracy and training convergence speed. We show how these networks can be leveraged for the imputation of time series, with applications on both univariate and multivariate data. Finally, we propose a hypernetwork architecture that leverages INRs to learn a compressed latent representation of an entire time series dataset. We introduce an FFT-based loss to guide training so that all frequencies are preserved in the time series. We show that this network can be used to encode time series as INRs, and their embeddings can be interpolated to generate new time series from existing ones. We evaluate our generative method by using it for data augmentation, and show that it is competitive against current state-of-the-art approaches for augmentation of time series.
  - [NIDN: Neural Inverse Design of Nanostructures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05480) | [code]
    > In the recent decade, computational tools have become central in material design, allowing rapid development cycles at reduced costs. Machine learning tools are especially on the rise in photonics. However, the inversion of the Maxwell equations needed for the design is particularly challenging from an optimization standpoint, requiring sophisticated software. We present an innovative, open-source software tool called Neural Inverse Design of Nanostructures (NIDN) that allows designing complex, stacked material nanostructures using a physics-based deep learning approach. Instead of a derivative-free or data-driven optimization or learning method, we perform a gradient-based neural network training where we directly optimize the material and its structure based on its spectral characteristics. NIDN supports two different solvers, rigorous coupled-wave analysis and a finite-difference time-domain method. The utility and validity of NIDN are demonstrated on several synthetic examples as well as the design of a 1550 nm filter and anti-reflection coating. Results match experimental baselines, other simulation tools, and the desired spectral characteristics. Given its full modularity in regard to network architectures and Maxwell solvers as well as open-source, permissive availability, NIDN will be able to support computational material design processes in a broad range of applications.
  - [Monte Carlo Denoising Using Implicit Neural Representation](https://oaktrust.library.tamu.edu/handle/1969.1/196567) | [code]
    > Monte Carlo path tracing is a popular 3D rendering technique in computer graphics, but it often requires a costly tradeoff between the amount of noise in the image and computation time. Therefore, it is useful to attempt to “smooth out” a noisy image, typically by constructing new data between the samples or applying filters to the image. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of training a neural network to implicitly represent the radiance of a fixed-viewpoint scene as a continuous function. We implement the neural network using a multilayer perceptron network and train it on a sparsely sampled image that is generated by an offline Monte Carlo renderer. This training data uses the (x, y) coordinate of each sample on the image plane as inputs and the RGB color of the sample as outputs. Additionally, we provide the network with the surface normal, depth, and albedo of the first ray intersection as extra inputs alongside the pixel coordinates. These extra input dimensions improve the quality of the implicit representation by helping the network account for changes in depth, normal, and diffuse color. Once the network is trained on the sparsely sampled scene, we can densely sample the network many times per pixel to create the final denoised image. We find that this network can quickly learn and denoise images in scenes with soft lighting and glossy reflections, and it can easily handle discontinuities in depth, normal, and diffuse color with just a small amount of training.

  - [DoF-NeRF: Depth-of-Field Meets Neural Radiance Fields, ACMMM2022](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.00945) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/zijinwuzijin/DoF-NeRF)
    > Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and its variants have exhibited great success on representing 3D scenes and synthesizing photo-realistic novel views. However, they are generally based on the pinhole camera model and assume all-in-focus inputs. This limits their applicability as images captured from the real world often have finite depth-of-field (DoF). To mitigate this issue, we introduce DoF-NeRF, a novel neural rendering approach that can deal with shallow DoF inputs and can simulate DoF effect. In particular, it extends NeRF to simulate the aperture of lens following the principles of geometric optics. Such a physical guarantee allows DoF-NeRF to operate views with different focus configurations. Benefiting from explicit aperture modeling, DoF-NeRF also enables direct manipulation of DoF effect by adjusting virtual aperture and focus parameters. It is plug-and-play and can be inserted into NeRF-based frameworks. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that, DoF-NeRF not only performs comparably with NeRF in the all-in-focus setting, but also can synthesize all-in-focus novel views conditioned on shallow DoF inputs. An interesting application of DoF-NeRF to DoF rendering is also demonstrated.
  - [Neural Density-Distance Fields, ECCV2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14455) | [***``[code]``***](https://ueda0319.github.io/neddf/)
    > The success of neural fields for 3D vision tasks is now indisputable. Following this trend, several methods aiming for visual localization (e.g., SLAM) have been proposed to estimate distance or density fields using neural fields. However, it is difficult to achieve high localization performance by only density fields-based methods such as Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) since they do not provide density gradient in most empty regions. On the other hand, distance field-based methods such as Neural Implicit Surface (NeuS) have limitations in objects' surface shapes. This paper proposes Neural Density-Distance Field (NeDDF), a novel 3D representation that reciprocally constrains the distance and density fields. We extend distance field formulation to shapes with no explicit boundary surface, such as fur or smoke, which enable explicit conversion from distance field to density field. Consistent distance and density fields realized by explicit conversion enable both robustness to initial values and high-quality registration. Furthermore, the consistency between fields allows fast convergence from sparse point clouds. Experiments show that NeDDF can achieve high localization performance while providing comparable results to NeRF on novel view synthesis. The code is available at this https URL.
  - [End-to-end View Synthesis via NeRF Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14741) | [code]
    > In this paper, we present a simple seq2seq formulation for view synthesis where we take a set of ray points as input and output colors corresponding to the rays. Directly applying a standard transformer on this seq2seq formulation has two limitations. First, the standard attention cannot successfully fit the volumetric rendering procedure, and therefore high-frequency components are missing in the synthesized views. Second, applying global attention to all rays and pixels is extremely inefficient. Inspired by the neural radiance field (NeRF), we propose the NeRF attention (NeRFA) to address the above problems. On the one hand, NeRFA considers the volumetric rendering equation as a soft feature modulation procedure. In this way, the feature modulation enhances the transformers with the NeRF-like inductive bias. On the other hand, NeRFA performs multi-stage attention to reduce the computational overhead. Furthermore, the NeRFA model adopts the ray and pixel transformers to learn the interactions between rays and pixels. NeRFA demonstrates superior performance over NeRF and NerFormer on four datasets: DeepVoxels, Blender, LLFF, and CO3D. Besides, NeRFA establishes a new state-of-the-art under two settings: the single-scene view synthesis and the category-centric novel view synthesis. The code will be made publicly available.
  - [Neural Strands: Learning Hair Geometry and Appearance from Multi-View Images, ECCV2022](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.14067) | [***``[code]``***](https://radualexandru.github.io/neural_strands/)
    > We present Neural Strands, a novel learning framework for modeling accurate hair geometry and appearance from multi-view image inputs. The learned hair model can be rendered in real-time from any viewpoint with high-fidelity view-dependent effects. Our model achieves intuitive shape and style control unlike volumetric counterparts. To enable these properties, we propose a novel hair representation based on a neural scalp texture that encodes the geometry and appearance of individual strands at each texel location. Furthermore, we introduce a novel neural rendering framework based on rasterization of the learned hair strands. Our neural rendering is strand-accurate and anti-aliased, making the rendering view-consistent and photorealistic. Combining appearance with a multi-view geometric prior, we enable, for the first time, the joint learning of appearance and explicit hair geometry from a multi-view setup. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in terms of fidelity and efficiency for various hairstyles.
  - [Neural Green’s function for Laplacian systems, Computer & Graphics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0097849322001406) | [code]
    > Solving linear system of equations stemming from Laplacian operators is at the heart of a wide range of applications. Due to the sparsity of the linear systems, iterative solvers such as Conjugate Gradient and Multigrid are usually employed when the solution has a large number of degrees of freedom. These iterative solvers can be seen as sparse approximations of the Green’s function for the Laplacian operator. In this paper we propose a machine learning approach that regresses a Green’s function from boundary conditions. This is enabled by a Green’s function that can be effectively represented in a multi-scale fashion, drastically reducing the cost associated with a dense matrix representation. Additionally, since the Green’s function is solely dependent on boundary conditions, training the proposed neural network does not require sampling the right-hand side of the linear system. We show results that our method outperforms state of the art Conjugate Gradient and Multigrid methods.
  - [On the Learnability of Physical Concepts: Can a Neural Network Understand What's Real?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12186) | [code]
    > We revisit the classic signal-to-symbol barrier in light of the remarkable ability of deep neural networks to generate realistic synthetic data. DeepFakes and spoofing highlight the feebleness of the link between physical reality and its abstract representation, whether learned by a digital computer or a biological agent. Starting from a widely applicable definition of abstract concept, we show that standard feed-forward architectures cannot capture but trivial concepts, regardless of the number of weights and the amount of training data, despite being extremely effective classifiers. On the other hand, architectures that incorporate recursion can represent a significantly larger class of concepts, but may still be unable to learn them from a finite dataset. We qualitatively describe the class of concepts that can be "understood" by modern architectures trained with variants of stochastic gradient descent, using a (free energy) Lagrangian to measure information complexity. Even if a concept has been understood, however, a network has no means of communicating its understanding to an external agent, except through continuous interaction and validation. We then characterize physical objects as abstract concepts and use the previous analysis to show that physical objects can be encoded by finite architectures. However, to understand physical concepts, sensors must provide persistently exciting observations, for which the ability to control the data acquisition process is essential (active perception). The importance of control depends on the modality, benefiting visual more than acoustic or chemical perception. Finally, we conclude that binding physical entities to digital identities is possible in finite time with finite resources, solving in principle the signal-to-symbol barrier problem, but we highlight the need for continuous validation.

  - [NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis, ECCV2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934) | [***``[code]``***](http://tancik.com/nerf)
    > We present a method that achieves state-of-the-art results for synthesizing novel views of complex scenes by optimizing an underlying continuous volumetric scene function using a sparse set of input views. Our algorithm represents a scene using a fully-connected (non-convolutional) deep network, whose input is a single continuous 5D coordinate (spatial location (x,y,z) and viewing direction (θ,ϕ)) and whose output is the volume density and view-dependent emitted radiance at that spatial location. We synthesize views by querying 5D coordinates along camera rays and use classic volume rendering techniques to project the output colors and densities into an image. Because volume rendering is naturally differentiable, the only input required to optimize our representation is a set of images with known camera poses. We describe how to effectively optimize neural radiance fields to render photorealistic novel views of scenes with complicated geometry and appearance, and demonstrate results that outperform prior work on neural rendering and view synthesis. View synthesis results are best viewed as videos, so we urge readers to view our supplementary video for convincing comparisons.
  - [NeRF in the Wild: Neural Radiance Fields for Unconstrained Photo Collections, CVPR2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02268) | [code]
    > We present a learning-based method for synthesizing novel views of complex scenes using only unstructured collections of in-the-wild photographs. We build on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), which uses the weights of a multilayer perceptron to model the density and color of a scene as a function of 3D coordinates. While NeRF works well on images of static subjects captured under controlled settings, it is incapable of modeling many ubiquitous, real-world phenomena in uncontrolled images, such as variable illumination or transient occluders. We introduce a series of extensions to NeRF to address these issues, thereby enabling accurate reconstructions from unstructured image collections taken from the internet. We apply our system, dubbed NeRF-W, to internet photo collections of famous landmarks, and demonstrate temporally consistent novel view renderings that are significantly closer to photorealism than the prior state of the art.
  - [Ha-NeRF: Hallucinated Neural Radiance Fields in the Wild, CVPR2022](https://rover-xingyu.github.io/Ha-NeRF/) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/rover-xingyu/Ha-NeRF)
    > Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has recently gained popularity for its impressive novel view synthesis ability. This paper studies the problem of hallucinated NeRF: i.e., recovering a realistic NeRF at a different time of day from a group of tourism images. Existing solutions adopt NeRF with a controllable appearance embedding to render novel views under various conditions, but they cannot render view-consistent images with an unseen appearance. To solve this problem, we present an end-to-end framework for constructing a hallucinated NeRF, dubbed as Ha-NeRF. Specifically, we propose an appearance hallucination module to handle time-varying appearances and transfer them to novel views. Considering the complex occlusions of tourism images, we introduce an anti-occlusion module to decompose the static subjects for visibility accurately. Experimental results on synthetic data and real tourism photo collections demonstrate that our method can hallucinate the desired appearances and render occlusion-free images from different views.
  - [Nerfies: Deformable Neural Radiance Fields, ICCV2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12948) | [code]
    > We present the first method capable of photorealistically reconstructing deformable scenes using photos/videos captured casually from mobile phones. Our approach augments neural radiance fields (NeRF) by optimizing an additional continuous volumetric deformation field that warps each observed point into a canonical 5D NeRF. We observe that these NeRF-like deformation fields are prone to local minima, and propose a coarse-to-fine optimization method for coordinate-based models that allows for more robust optimization. By adapting principles from geometry processing and physical simulation to NeRF-like models, we propose an elastic regularization of the deformation field that further improves robustness. We show that our method can turn casually captured selfie photos/videos into deformable NeRF models that allow for photorealistic renderings of the subject from arbitrary viewpoints, which we dub "nerfies." We evaluate our method by collecting time-synchronized data using a rig with two mobile phones, yielding train/validation images of the same pose at different viewpoints. We show that our method faithfully reconstructs non-rigidly deforming scenes and reproduces unseen views with high fidelity.
  - [D-NeRF: Neural Radiance Fields for Dynamic Scenes, CVPR2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13961) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/albertpumarola/D-NeRF)
    > Neural rendering techniques combining machine learning with geometric reasoning have arisen as one of the most promising approaches for synthesizing novel views of a scene from a sparse set of images. Among these, stands out the Neural radiance fields (NeRF), which trains a deep network to map 5D input coordinates (representing spatial location and viewing direction) into a volume density and view-dependent emitted radiance. However, despite achieving an unprecedented level of photorealism on the generated images, NeRF is only applicable to static scenes, where the same spatial location can be queried from different images. In this paper we introduce D-NeRF, a method that extends neural radiance fields to a dynamic domain, allowing to reconstruct and render novel images of objects under rigid and non-rigid motions from a \emph{single} camera moving around the scene. For this purpose we consider time as an additional input to the system, and split the learning process in two main stages: one that encodes the scene into a canonical space and another that maps this canonical representation into the deformed scene at a particular time. Both mappings are simultaneously learned using fully-connected networks. Once the networks are trained, D-NeRF can render novel images, controlling both the camera view and the time variable, and thus, the object movement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on scenes with objects under rigid, articulated and non-rigid motions. Code, model weights and the dynamic scenes dataset will be released.
  - [Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields for Monocular 4D Facial Avatar Reconstruction, CVPR2021](https://gafniguy.github.io/4D-Facial-Avatars/) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/gafniguy/4D-Facial-Avatars)
    > We present dynamic neural radiance fields for modeling the appearance and dynamics of a human face. Digitally modeling and reconstructing a talking human is a key building-block for a variety of applications. Especially, for telepresence applications in AR or VR, a faithful reproduction of the appearance including novel viewpoint or head-poses is required. In contrast to state-of-the-art approaches that model the geometry and material properties explicitly, or are purely image-based, we introduce an implicit representation of the head based on scene representation networks. To handle the dynamics of the face, we combine our scene representation network with a low-dimensional morphable model which provides explicit control over pose and expressions. We use volumetric rendering to generate images from this hybrid representation and demonstrate that such a dynamic neural scene representation can be learned from monocular input data only, without the need of a specialized capture setup. In our experiments, we show that this learned volumetric representation allows for photo-realistic image generation that surpasses the quality of state-of-the-art video-based reenactment methods.
  - [PVA: Pixel-aligned Volumetric Avatars, CVPR2021](https://volumetric-avatars.github.io/) | [code]
    > Acquisition and rendering of photorealistic human heads is a highly challenging research problem of particular importance for virtual telepresence. Currently, the highest quality is achieved by volumetric approaches trained in a person-specific manner on multi-view data. These models better represent fine structure, such as hair, compared to simpler mesh-based models. Volumetric models typically employ a global code to represent facial expressions, such that they can be driven by a small set of animation parameters. While such architectures achieve impressive rendering quality, they can not easily be extended to the multi-identity setting. In this paper, we devise a novel approach for predicting volumetric avatars of the human head given just a small number of inputs. We enable generalization across identities by a novel parameterization that combines neural radiance fields with local, pixel-aligned features extracted directly from the inputs, thus side-stepping the need for very deep or complex networks. Our approach is trained in an end-to-end manner solely based on a photometric rerendering loss without requiring explicit 3D supervision.We demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing state of the art in terms of quality and is able to generate faithful facial expressions in a multi-identity setting.
  - [Animatable Neural Radiance Fields for Human Body Modeling, ICCV2021](https://zju3dv.github.io/animatable_nerf/) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/zju3dv/animatable_nerf)
    > This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing an animatable human model from a multi-view video. Some recent works have proposed to decompose a non-rigidly deforming scene into a canonical neural radiance field and a set of deformation fields that map observation-space points to the canonical space, thereby enabling them to learn the dynamic scene from images. However, they represent the deformation field as translational vector field or SE(3) field, which makes the optimization highly under-constrained. Moreover, these representations cannot be explicitly controlled by input motions. Instead, we introduce neural blend weight fields to produce the deformation fields. Based on the skeleton-driven deformation, blend weight fields are used with 3D human skeletons to generate observation-to-canonical and canonical-to-observation correspondences. Since 3D human skeletons are more observable, they can regularize the learning of deformation fields. Moreover, the learned blend weight fields can be combined with input skeletal motions to generate new deformation fields to animate the human model. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms recent human synthesis methods. The code will be available at https://zju3dv.github.io/animatable_nerf/.

    > Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) achieve impressive view synthesis results for a variety of capture settings, including 360 capture of bounded scenes and forward-facing capture of bounded and unbounded scenes. NeRF fits multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) representing view-invariant opacity and view-dependent color volumes to a set of training images, and samples novel views based on volume rendering techniques. In this technical report, we first remark on radiance fields and their potential ambiguities, namely the shape-radiance ambiguity, and analyze NeRF's success in avoiding such ambiguities. Second, we address a parametrization issue involved in applying NeRF to 360 captures of objects within large-scale, unbounded 3D scenes. Our method improves view synthesis fidelity in this challenging scenario. Code is available at this https URL.

    > Recent implicit neural rendering methods have demonstrated that it is possible to learn accurate view synthesis for complex scenes by predicting their volumetric density and color supervised solely by a set of RGB images. However, existing methods are restricted to learning efficient representations of static scenes that encode all scene objects into a single neural network, and lack the ability to represent dynamic scenes and decompositions into individual scene objects. In this work, we present the first neural rendering method that decomposes dynamic scenes into scene graphs. We propose a learned scene graph representation, which encodes object transformation and radiance, to efficiently render novel arrangements and views of the scene. To this end, we learn implicitly encoded scenes, combined with a jointly learned latent representation to describe objects with a single implicit function. We assess the proposed method on synthetic and real automotive data, validating that our approach learns dynamic scenes -- only by observing a video of this scene -- and allows for rendering novel photo-realistic views of novel scene compositions with unseen sets of objects at unseen poses.
  - [In-Place Scene Labelling and Understanding with Implicit Scene Representation, ICCV2021(oral)](https://shuaifengzhi.com/Semantic-NeRF/) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/Harry-Zhi/semantic_nerf/)
    > Semantic labelling is highly correlated with geometry and radiance reconstruction, as scene entities with similar shape and appearance are more likely to come from similar classes. Recent implicit neural reconstruction techniques are appealing as they do not require prior training data, but the same fully self-supervised approach is not possible for semantics because labels are human-defined properties.
