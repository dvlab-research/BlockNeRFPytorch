  - [Implicit Full Waveform Inversion with Deep Neural Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03525) | [code]
    > Full waveform inversion (FWI) commonly stands for the state-of-the-art approach for imaging subsurface structures and physical parameters, however, its implementation usually faces great challenges, such as building a good initial model to escape from local minima, and evaluating the uncertainty of inversion results. In this paper, we propose the implicit full waveform inversion (IFWI) algorithm using continuously and implicitly defined deep neural representations. Compared to FWI, which is sensitive to the initial model, IFWI benefits from the increased degrees of freedom with deep learning optimization, thus allowing to start from a random initialization, which greatly reduces the risk of non-uniqueness and being trapped in local minima. Both theoretical and experimental analyses indicates that, given a random initial model, IFWI is able to converge to the global minimum and produce a high-resolution image of subsurface with fine structures. In addition, uncertainty analysis of IFWI can be easily performed by approximating Bayesian inference with various deep learning approaches, which is analyzed in this paper by adding dropout neurons. Furthermore, IFWI has a certain degree of robustness and strong generalization ability that are exemplified in the experiments of various 2D geological models. With proper setup, IFWI can also be well suited for multi-scale joint geophysical inversion.

  - [FoV-NeRF: Foveated Neural Radiance Fields for Virtual Reality, TVCG2022](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9872532) | [code]
    > Virtual Reality (VR) is becoming ubiquitous with the rise of consumer displays and commercial VR platforms. Such displays require low latency and high quality rendering of synthetic imagery with reduced compute overheads. Recent advances in neural rendering showed promise of unlocking new possibilities in 3D computer graphics via image-based representations of virtual or physical environments. Specifically, the neural radiance fields (NeRF) demonstrated that photo-realistic quality and continuous view changes of 3D scenes can be achieved without loss of view-dependent effects. While NeRF can significantly benefit rendering for VR applications, it faces unique challenges posed by high field-of-view, high resolution, and stereoscopic/egocentric viewing, typically causing low quality and high latency of the rendered images. In VR, this not only harms the interaction experience but may also cause sickness. To tackle these problems toward six-degrees-of-freedom, egocentric, and stereo NeRF in VR, we present the first gaze-contingent 3D neural representation and view synthesis method . We incorporate the human psychophysics of visual- and stereo-acuity into an egocentric neural representation of 3D scenery. We then jointly optimize the latency/performance and visual quality while mutually bridging human perception and neural scene synthesis to achieve perceptually high-quality immersive interaction. We conducted both objective analysis and subjective studies to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. We find that our method significantly reduces latency (up to 99% time reduction compared with NeRF) without loss of high-fidelity rendering (perceptually identical to full-resolution ground truth). The presented approach may serve as the first step toward future VR/AR systems that capture, teleport, and visualize remote environments in real-time.

    > This paper proposes CLONeR, which significantly improves upon NeRF by allowing it to model large outdoor driving scenes that are observed from sparse input sensor views. This is achieved by decoupling occupancy and color learning within the NeRF framework into separate Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) trained using LiDAR and camera data, respectively. In addition, this paper proposes a novel method to build differentiable 3D Occupancy Grid Maps (OGM) alongside the NeRF model, and leverage this occupancy grid for improved sampling of points along a ray for volumetric rendering in metric space.

This representation can be optimized from calibrated images via gradient methods and regularization without any neural components. On standard, benchmark tasks, Plenoxels are optimized two orders of magnitude faster than Neural Radiance Fields with no loss in visual quality.

  - [HyperTime: Implicit Neural Representation for Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05836) | [code]
    > Implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool that provides an accurate and resolution-independent encoding of data. Their robustness as general approximators has been shown in a wide variety of data sources, with applications on image, sound, and 3D scene representation. However, little attention has been given to leveraging these architectures for the representation and analysis of time series data. In this paper, we analyze the representation of time series using INRs, comparing different activation functions in terms of reconstruction accuracy and training convergence speed. We show how these networks can be leveraged for the imputation of time series, with applications on both univariate and multivariate data. Finally, we propose a hypernetwork architecture that leverages INRs to learn a compressed latent representation of an entire time series dataset. We introduce an FFT-based loss to guide training so that all frequencies are preserved in the time series. We show that this network can be used to encode time series as INRs, and their embeddings can be interpolated to generate new time series from existing ones. We evaluate our generative method by using it for data augmentation, and show that it is competitive against current state-of-the-art approaches for augmentation of time series.
  - [NIDN: Neural Inverse Design of Nanostructures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05480) | [code]
    > In the recent decade, computational tools have become central in material design, allowing rapid development cycles at reduced costs. Machine learning tools are especially on the rise in photonics. However, the inversion of the Maxwell equations needed for the design is particularly challenging from an optimization standpoint, requiring sophisticated software. We present an innovative, open-source software tool called Neural Inverse Design of Nanostructures (NIDN) that allows designing complex, stacked material nanostructures using a physics-based deep learning approach. Instead of a derivative-free or data-driven optimization or learning method, we perform a gradient-based neural network training where we directly optimize the material and its structure based on its spectral characteristics. NIDN supports two different solvers, rigorous coupled-wave analysis and a finite-difference time-domain method. The utility and validity of NIDN are demonstrated on several synthetic examples as well as the design of a 1550 nm filter and anti-reflection coating. Results match experimental baselines, other simulation tools, and the desired spectral characteristics. Given its full modularity in regard to network architectures and Maxwell solvers as well as open-source, permissive availability, NIDN will be able to support computational material design processes in a broad range of applications.
  - [Monte Carlo Denoising Using Implicit Neural Representation](https://oaktrust.library.tamu.edu/handle/1969.1/196567) | [code]
    > Monte Carlo path tracing is a popular 3D rendering technique in computer graphics, but it often requires a costly tradeoff between the amount of noise in the image and computation time. Therefore, it is useful to attempt to “smooth out” a noisy image, typically by constructing new data between the samples or applying filters to the image. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of training a neural network to implicitly represent the radiance of a fixed-viewpoint scene as a continuous function. We implement the neural network using a multilayer perceptron network and train it on a sparsely sampled image that is generated by an offline Monte Carlo renderer. This training data uses the (x, y) coordinate of each sample on the image plane as inputs and the RGB color of the sample as outputs. Additionally, we provide the network with the surface normal, depth, and albedo of the first ray intersection as extra inputs alongside the pixel coordinates. These extra input dimensions improve the quality of the implicit representation by helping the network account for changes in depth, normal, and diffuse color. Once the network is trained on the sparsely sampled scene, we can densely sample the network many times per pixel to create the final denoised image. We find that this network can quickly learn and denoise images in scenes with soft lighting and glossy reflections, and it can easily handle discontinuities in depth, normal, and diffuse color with just a small amount of training.

  - [DoF-NeRF: Depth-of-Field Meets Neural Radiance Fields, ACMMM2022](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.00945) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/zijinwuzijin/DoF-NeRF)
    > Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and its variants have exhibited great success on representing 3D scenes and synthesizing photo-realistic novel views. However, they are generally based on the pinhole camera model and assume all-in-focus inputs. This limits their applicability as images captured from the real world often have finite depth-of-field (DoF). To mitigate this issue, we introduce DoF-NeRF, a novel neural rendering approach that can deal with shallow DoF inputs and can simulate DoF effect. In particular, it extends NeRF to simulate the aperture of lens following the principles of geometric optics. Such a physical guarantee allows DoF-NeRF to operate views with different focus configurations. Benefiting from explicit aperture modeling, DoF-NeRF also enables direct manipulation of DoF effect by adjusting virtual aperture and focus parameters. It is plug-and-play and can be inserted into NeRF-based frameworks. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that, DoF-NeRF not only performs comparably with NeRF in the all-in-focus setting, but also can synthesize all-in-focus novel views conditioned on shallow DoF inputs. An interesting application of DoF-NeRF to DoF rendering is also demonstrated.
  - [Neural Density-Distance Fields, ECCV2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14455) | [***``[code]``***](https://ueda0319.github.io/neddf/)
    > The success of neural fields for 3D vision tasks is now indisputable. Following this trend, several methods aiming for visual localization (e.g., SLAM) have been proposed to estimate distance or density fields using neural fields. However, it is difficult to achieve high localization performance by only density fields-based methods such as Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) since they do not provide density gradient in most empty regions. On the other hand, distance field-based methods such as Neural Implicit Surface (NeuS) have limitations in objects' surface shapes. This paper proposes Neural Density-Distance Field (NeDDF), a novel 3D representation that reciprocally constrains the distance and density fields. We extend distance field formulation to shapes with no explicit boundary surface, such as fur or smoke, which enable explicit conversion from distance field to density field. Consistent distance and density fields realized by explicit conversion enable both robustness to initial values and high-quality registration. Furthermore, the consistency between fields allows fast convergence from sparse point clouds. Experiments show that NeDDF can achieve high localization performance while providing comparable results to NeRF on novel view synthesis. The code is available at this https URL.
  - [End-to-end View Synthesis via NeRF Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14741) | [code]
    > In this paper, we present a simple seq2seq formulation for view synthesis where we take a set of ray points as input and output colors corresponding to the rays. Directly applying a standard transformer on this seq2seq formulation has two limitations. First, the standard attention cannot successfully fit the volumetric rendering procedure, and therefore high-frequency components are missing in the synthesized views. Second, applying global attention to all rays and pixels is extremely inefficient. Inspired by the neural radiance field (NeRF), we propose the NeRF attention (NeRFA) to address the above problems. On the one hand, NeRFA considers the volumetric rendering equation as a soft feature modulation procedure. In this way, the feature modulation enhances the transformers with the NeRF-like inductive bias. On the other hand, NeRFA performs multi-stage attention to reduce the computational overhead. Furthermore, the NeRFA model adopts the ray and pixel transformers to learn the interactions between rays and pixels. NeRFA demonstrates superior performance over NeRF and NerFormer on four datasets: DeepVoxels, Blender, LLFF, and CO3D. Besides, NeRFA establishes a new state-of-the-art under two settings: the single-scene view synthesis and the category-centric novel view synthesis. The code will be made publicly available.
  - [Neural Strands: Learning Hair Geometry and Appearance from Multi-View Images, ECCV2022](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.14067) | [***``[code]``***](https://radualexandru.github.io/neural_strands/)
    > We present Neural Strands, a novel learning framework for modeling accurate hair geometry and appearance from multi-view image inputs. The learned hair model can be rendered in real-time from any viewpoint with high-fidelity view-dependent effects. Our model achieves intuitive shape and style control unlike volumetric counterparts. To enable these properties, we propose a novel hair representation based on a neural scalp texture that encodes the geometry and appearance of individual strands at each texel location. Furthermore, we introduce a novel neural rendering framework based on rasterization of the learned hair strands. Our neural rendering is strand-accurate and anti-aliased, making the rendering view-consistent and photorealistic. Combining appearance with a multi-view geometric prior, we enable, for the first time, the joint learning of appearance and explicit hair geometry from a multi-view setup. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in terms of fidelity and efficiency for various hairstyles.
  - [Neural Green’s function for Laplacian systems, Computer & Graphics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0097849322001406) | [code]
    > Solving linear system of equations stemming from Laplacian operators is at the heart of a wide range of applications. Due to the sparsity of the linear systems, iterative solvers such as Conjugate Gradient and Multigrid are usually employed when the solution has a large number of degrees of freedom. These iterative solvers can be seen as sparse approximations of the Green’s function for the Laplacian operator. In this paper we propose a machine learning approach that regresses a Green’s function from boundary conditions. This is enabled by a Green’s function that can be effectively represented in a multi-scale fashion, drastically reducing the cost associated with a dense matrix representation. Additionally, since the Green’s function is solely dependent on boundary conditions, training the proposed neural network does not require sampling the right-hand side of the linear system. We show results that our method outperforms state of the art Conjugate Gradient and Multigrid methods.
  - [On the Learnability of Physical Concepts: Can a Neural Network Understand What's Real?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12186) | [code]
    > We revisit the classic signal-to-symbol barrier in light of the remarkable ability of deep neural networks to generate realistic synthetic data. DeepFakes and spoofing highlight the feebleness of the link between physical reality and its abstract representation, whether learned by a digital computer or a biological agent. Starting from a widely applicable definition of abstract concept, we show that standard feed-forward architectures cannot capture but trivial concepts, regardless of the number of weights and the amount of training data, despite being extremely effective classifiers. On the other hand, architectures that incorporate recursion can represent a significantly larger class of concepts, but may still be unable to learn them from a finite dataset. We qualitatively describe the class of concepts that can be "understood" by modern architectures trained with variants of stochastic gradient descent, using a (free energy) Lagrangian to measure information complexity. Even if a concept has been understood, however, a network has no means of communicating its understanding to an external agent, except through continuous interaction and validation. We then characterize physical objects as abstract concepts and use the previous analysis to show that physical objects can be encoded by finite architectures. However, to understand physical concepts, sensors must provide persistently exciting observations, for which the ability to control the data acquisition process is essential (active perception). The importance of control depends on the modality, benefiting visual more than acoustic or chemical perception. Finally, we conclude that binding physical entities to digital identities is possible in finite time with finite resources, solving in principle the signal-to-symbol barrier problem, but we highlight the need for continuous validation.

  - [NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis, ECCV2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934) | [***``[code]``***](http://tancik.com/nerf)
    > We present a method that achieves state-of-the-art results for synthesizing novel views of complex scenes by optimizing an underlying continuous volumetric scene function using a sparse set of input views. Our algorithm represents a scene using a fully-connected (non-convolutional) deep network, whose input is a single continuous 5D coordinate (spatial location (x,y,z) and viewing direction (θ,ϕ)) and whose output is the volume density and view-dependent emitted radiance at that spatial location. We synthesize views by querying 5D coordinates along camera rays and use classic volume rendering techniques to project the output colors and densities into an image. Because volume rendering is naturally differentiable, the only input required to optimize our representation is a set of images with known camera poses. We describe how to effectively optimize neural radiance fields to render photorealistic novel views of scenes with complicated geometry and appearance, and demonstrate results that outperform prior work on neural rendering and view synthesis. View synthesis results are best viewed as videos, so we urge readers to view our supplementary video for convincing comparisons.
  - [NeRF in the Wild: Neural Radiance Fields for Unconstrained Photo Collections, CVPR2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02268) | [code]
    > We present a learning-based method for synthesizing novel views of complex scenes using only unstructured collections of in-the-wild photographs. We build on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), which uses the weights of a multilayer perceptron to model the density and color of a scene as a function of 3D coordinates. While NeRF works well on images of static subjects captured under controlled settings, it is incapable of modeling many ubiquitous, real-world phenomena in uncontrolled images, such as variable illumination or transient occluders. We introduce a series of extensions to NeRF to address these issues, thereby enabling accurate reconstructions from unstructured image collections taken from the internet. We apply our system, dubbed NeRF-W, to internet photo collections of famous landmarks, and demonstrate temporally consistent novel view renderings that are significantly closer to photorealism than the prior state of the art.
  - [Ha-NeRF: Hallucinated Neural Radiance Fields in the Wild, CVPR2022](https://rover-xingyu.github.io/Ha-NeRF/) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/rover-xingyu/Ha-NeRF)
    > Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has recently gained popularity for its impressive novel view synthesis ability. This paper studies the problem of hallucinated NeRF: i.e., recovering a realistic NeRF at a different time of day from a group of tourism images. Existing solutions adopt NeRF with a controllable appearance embedding to render novel views under various conditions, but they cannot render view-consistent images with an unseen appearance. To solve this problem, we present an end-to-end framework for constructing a hallucinated NeRF, dubbed as Ha-NeRF. Specifically, we propose an appearance hallucination module to handle time-varying appearances and transfer them to novel views. Considering the complex occlusions of tourism images, we introduce an anti-occlusion module to decompose the static subjects for visibility accurately. Experimental results on synthetic data and real tourism photo collections demonstrate that our method can hallucinate the desired appearances and render occlusion-free images from different views.
  - [Nerfies: Deformable Neural Radiance Fields, ICCV2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12948) | [code]
    > We present the first method capable of photorealistically reconstructing deformable scenes using photos/videos captured casually from mobile phones. Our approach augments neural radiance fields (NeRF) by optimizing an additional continuous volumetric deformation field that warps each observed point into a canonical 5D NeRF. We observe that these NeRF-like deformation fields are prone to local minima, and propose a coarse-to-fine optimization method for coordinate-based models that allows for more robust optimization. By adapting principles from geometry processing and physical simulation to NeRF-like models, we propose an elastic regularization of the deformation field that further improves robustness. We show that our method can turn casually captured selfie photos/videos into deformable NeRF models that allow for photorealistic renderings of the subject from arbitrary viewpoints, which we dub "nerfies." We evaluate our method by collecting time-synchronized data using a rig with two mobile phones, yielding train/validation images of the same pose at different viewpoints. We show that our method faithfully reconstructs non-rigidly deforming scenes and reproduces unseen views with high fidelity.
  - [D-NeRF: Neural Radiance Fields for Dynamic Scenes, CVPR2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13961) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/albertpumarola/D-NeRF)
    > Neural rendering techniques combining machine learning with geometric reasoning have arisen as one of the most promising approaches for synthesizing novel views of a scene from a sparse set of images. Among these, stands out the Neural radiance fields (NeRF), which trains a deep network to map 5D input coordinates (representing spatial location and viewing direction) into a volume density and view-dependent emitted radiance. However, despite achieving an unprecedented level of photorealism on the generated images, NeRF is only applicable to static scenes, where the same spatial location can be queried from different images. In this paper we introduce D-NeRF, a method that extends neural radiance fields to a dynamic domain, allowing to reconstruct and render novel images of objects under rigid and non-rigid motions from a \emph{single} camera moving around the scene. For this purpose we consider time as an additional input to the system, and split the learning process in two main stages: one that encodes the scene into a canonical space and another that maps this canonical representation into the deformed scene at a particular time. Both mappings are simultaneously learned using fully-connected networks. Once the networks are trained, D-NeRF can render novel images, controlling both the camera view and the time variable, and thus, the object movement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on scenes with objects under rigid, articulated and non-rigid motions. Code, model weights and the dynamic scenes dataset will be released.
  - [Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields for Monocular 4D Facial Avatar Reconstruction, CVPR2021](https://gafniguy.github.io/4D-Facial-Avatars/) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/gafniguy/4D-Facial-Avatars)
    > We present dynamic neural radiance fields for modeling the appearance and dynamics of a human face. Digitally modeling and reconstructing a talking human is a key building-block for a variety of applications. Especially, for telepresence applications in AR or VR, a faithful reproduction of the appearance including novel viewpoint or head-poses is required. In contrast to state-of-the-art approaches that model the geometry and material properties explicitly, or are purely image-based, we introduce an implicit representation of the head based on scene representation networks. To handle the dynamics of the face, we combine our scene representation network with a low-dimensional morphable model which provides explicit control over pose and expressions. We use volumetric rendering to generate images from this hybrid representation and demonstrate that such a dynamic neural scene representation can be learned from monocular input data only, without the need of a specialized capture setup. In our experiments, we show that this learned volumetric representation allows for photo-realistic image generation that surpasses the quality of state-of-the-art video-based reenactment methods.
  - [PVA: Pixel-aligned Volumetric Avatars, CVPR2021](https://volumetric-avatars.github.io/) | [code]
    > Acquisition and rendering of photorealistic human heads is a highly challenging research problem of particular importance for virtual telepresence. Currently, the highest quality is achieved by volumetric approaches trained in a person-specific manner on multi-view data. These models better represent fine structure, such as hair, compared to simpler mesh-based models. Volumetric models typically employ a global code to represent facial expressions, such that they can be driven by a small set of animation parameters. While such architectures achieve impressive rendering quality, they can not easily be extended to the multi-identity setting. In this paper, we devise a novel approach for predicting volumetric avatars of the human head given just a small number of inputs. We enable generalization across identities by a novel parameterization that combines neural radiance fields with local, pixel-aligned features extracted directly from the inputs, thus side-stepping the need for very deep or complex networks. Our approach is trained in an end-to-end manner solely based on a photometric rerendering loss without requiring explicit 3D supervision.We demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing state of the art in terms of quality and is able to generate faithful facial expressions in a multi-identity setting.
  - [Animatable Neural Radiance Fields for Human Body Modeling, ICCV2021](https://zju3dv.github.io/animatable_nerf/) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/zju3dv/animatable_nerf)
    > This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing an animatable human model from a multi-view video. Some recent works have proposed to decompose a non-rigidly deforming scene into a canonical neural radiance field and a set of deformation fields that map observation-space points to the canonical space, thereby enabling them to learn the dynamic scene from images. However, they represent the deformation field as translational vector field or SE(3) field, which makes the optimization highly under-constrained. Moreover, these representations cannot be explicitly controlled by input motions. Instead, we introduce neural blend weight fields to produce the deformation fields. Based on the skeleton-driven deformation, blend weight fields are used with 3D human skeletons to generate observation-to-canonical and canonical-to-observation correspondences. Since 3D human skeletons are more observable, they can regularize the learning of deformation fields. Moreover, the learned blend weight fields can be combined with input skeletal motions to generate new deformation fields to animate the human model. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms recent human synthesis methods. The code will be available at https://zju3dv.github.io/animatable_nerf/.

NeRF fits multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) representing view-invariant opacity and view-dependent color volumes to a set of training images, and samples novel views based on volume rendering techniques. In this technical report, we first remark on radiance fields and their potential ambiguities, namely the shape-radiance ambiguity, and analyze NeRF's success in avoiding such ambiguities. Second, we address a parametrization issue involved in applying NeRF to 360 captures of objects within large-scale, unbounded 3D scenes. Our method improves view synthesis fidelity in this challenging scenario. Code is available at this https URL.

    > Recent implicit neural rendering methods have demonstrated that it is possible to learn accurate view synthesis for complex scenes by predicting their volumetric density and color supervised solely by a set of RGB images. However, existing methods are restricted to learning efficient representations of static scenes that encode all scene objects into a single neural network, and lack the ability to represent dynamic scenes and decompositions into individual scene objects. In this work, we present the first neural rendering method that decomposes dynamic scenes into scene graphs. We propose a learned scene graph representation, which encodes object transformation and radiance, to efficiently render novel arrangements and views of the scene. To this end, we learn implicitly encoded scenes, combined with a jointly learned latent representation to describe objects with a single implicit function. We assess the proposed method on synthetic and real automotive data, validating that our approach learns dynamic scenes -- only by observing a video of this scene -- and allows for rendering novel photo-realistic views of novel scene compositions with unseen sets of objects at unseen poses.
  - [In-Place Scene Labelling and Understanding with Implicit Scene Representation, ICCV2021(oral)](https://shuaifengzhi.com/Semantic-NeRF/) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/Harry-Zhi/semantic_nerf/)
    > Semantic labelling is highly correlated with geometry and radiance reconstruction, as scene entities with similar shape and appearance are more likely to come from similar classes. Recent implicit neural reconstruction techniques are appealing as they do not require prior training data, but the same fully self-supervised approach is not possible for semantics because labels are human-defined properties.
