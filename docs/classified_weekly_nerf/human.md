  - [Progressive Multi-scale Light Field Networks, 3DV2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06710) | [code]
    > Neural representations have shown great promise in their ability to represent radiance and light fields while being very compact compared to the image set representation. However, current representations are not well suited for streaming as decoding can only be done at a single level of detail and requires downloading the entire neural network model. Furthermore, high-resolution light field networks can exhibit flickering and aliasing as neural networks are sampled without appropriate filtering. To resolve these issues, we present a progressive multi-scale light field network that encodes a light field with multiple levels of detail. Lower levels of detail are encoded using fewer neural network weights enabling progressive streaming and reducing rendering time. Our progressive multi-scale light field network addresses aliasing by encoding smaller anti-aliased representations at its lower levels of detail. Additionally, per-pixel level of detail enables our representation to support dithered transitions and foveated rendering.

    > We present Neural Strands, a novel learning framework for modeling accurate hair geometry and appearance from multi-view image inputs. The learned hair model can be rendered in real-time from any viewpoint with high-fidelity view-dependent effects. Our model achieves intuitive shape and style control unlike volumetric counterparts. To enable these properties, we propose a novel hair representation based on a neural scalp texture that encodes the geometry and appearance of individual strands at each texel location. Furthermore, we introduce a novel neural rendering framework based on rasterization of the learned hair strands. Our neural rendering is strand-accurate and anti-aliased, making the rendering view-consistent and photorealistic. Combining appearance with a multi-view geometric prior, we enable, for the first time, the joint learning of appearance and explicit hair geometry from a multi-view setup. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in terms of fidelity and efficiency for various hairstyles.

  - [Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields for Monocular 4D Facial Avatar Reconstruction, CVPR2021](https://gafniguy.github.io/4D-Facial-Avatars/) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/gafniguy/4D-Facial-Avatars)
    > We present dynamic neural radiance fields for modeling the appearance and dynamics of a human face. Digitally modeling and reconstructing a talking human is a key building-block for a variety of applications. Especially, for telepresence applications in AR or VR, a faithful reproduction of the appearance including novel viewpoint or head-poses is required. In contrast to state-of-the-art approaches that model the geometry and material properties explicitly, or are purely image-based, we introduce an implicit representation of the head based on scene representation networks. To handle the dynamics of the face, we combine our scene representation network with a low-dimensional morphable model which provides explicit control over pose and expressions. We use volumetric rendering to generate images from this hybrid representation and demonstrate that such a dynamic neural scene representation can be learned from monocular input data only, without the need of a specialized capture setup. In our experiments, we show that this learned volumetric representation allows for photo-realistic image generation that surpasses the quality of state-of-the-art video-based reenactment methods.
  - [PVA: Pixel-aligned Volumetric Avatars, CVPR2021](https://volumetric-avatars.github.io/) | [code]
    > Acquisition and rendering of photorealistic human heads is a highly challenging research problem of particular importance for virtual telepresence. Currently, the highest quality is achieved by volumetric approaches trained in a person-specific manner on multi-view data. These models better represent fine structure, such as hair, compared to simpler mesh-based models. Volumetric models typically employ a global code to represent facial expressions, such that they can be driven by a small set of animation parameters. While such architectures achieve impressive rendering quality, they can not easily be extended to the multi-identity setting. In this paper, we devise a novel approach for predicting volumetric avatars of the human head given just a small number of inputs. We enable generalization across identities by a novel parameterization that combines neural radiance fields with local, pixel-aligned features extracted directly from the inputs, thus side-stepping the need for very deep or complex networks. Our approach is trained in an end-to-end manner solely based on a photometric rerendering loss without requiring explicit 3D supervision.We demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing state of the art in terms of quality and is able to generate faithful facial expressions in a multi-identity setting.
  - [Animatable Neural Radiance Fields for Human Body Modeling, ICCV2021](https://zju3dv.github.io/animatable_nerf/) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/zju3dv/animatable_nerf)
    > This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing an animatable human model from a multi-view video. Some recent works have proposed to decompose a non-rigidly deforming scene into a canonical neural radiance field and a set of deformation fields that map observation-space points to the canonical space, thereby enabling them to learn the dynamic scene from images. However, they represent the deformation field as translational vector field or SE(3) field, which makes the optimization highly under-constrained. Moreover, these representations cannot be explicitly controlled by input motions. Instead, we introduce neural blend weight fields to produce the deformation fields. Based on the skeleton-driven deformation, blend weight fields are used with 3D human skeletons to generate observation-to-canonical and canonical-to-observation correspondences. Since 3D human skeletons are more observable, they can regularize the learning of deformation fields. Moreover, the learned blend weight fields can be combined with input skeletal motions to generate new deformation fields to animate the human model. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms recent human synthesis methods. The code will be available at https://zju3dv.github.io/animatable_nerf/.
  - [Neural Actor: Neural Free-view Synthesis of Human Actors with Pose Control, SIGSIGGRAPH Asia 2021](https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/NeuralActor/) | [***``[code]``***](https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~lliu/projects/NeuralActor/)
    > We propose Neural Actor (NA), a new method for high-quality synthesis of humans from arbitrary viewpoints and under arbitrary controllable poses. Our method is built upon recent neural scene representation and rendering works which learn representations of geometry and appearance from only 2D images. While existing works demonstrated compelling rendering of static scenes and playback of dynamic scenes, photo-realistic reconstruction and rendering of humans with neural implicit methods, in particular under user-controlled novel poses, is still difficult. To address this problem, we utilize a coarse body model as the proxy to unwarp the surrounding 3D space into a canonical pose. A neural radiance field learns pose-dependent geometric deformations and pose- and view-dependent appearance effects in the canonical space from multi-view video input. To synthesize novel views of high fidelity dynamic geometry and appearance, we leverage 2D texture maps defined on the body model as latent variables for predicting residual deformations and the dynamic appearance. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves better quality than the state-of-the-arts on playback as well as novel pose synthesis, and can even generalize well to new poses that starkly differ from the training poses. Furthermore, our method also supports body shape control of the synthesized results.
  - [Neural Body: Implicit Neural Representations with Structured Latent Codes for Novel View Synthesis of Dynamic Humans, CVPR2021](https://zju3dv.github.io/neuralbody/) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/zju3dv/neuralbody)
    > This paper addresses the challenge of novel view synthesis for a human performer from a very sparse set of camera views. Some recent works have shown that learning implicit neural representations of 3D scenes achieves remarkable view synthesis quality given dense input views. However, the representation learning will be ill-posed if the views are highly sparse. To solve this ill-posed problem, our key idea is to integrate observations over video frames. To this end, we propose Neural Body, a new human body representation which assumes that the learned neural representations at different frames share the same set of latent codes anchored to a deformable mesh, so that the observations across frames can be naturally integrated. The deformable mesh also provides geometric guidance for the network to learn 3D representations more efficiently. To evaluate our approach, we create a multi-view dataset named ZJU-MoCap that captures performers with complex motions. Experiments on ZJU-MoCap show that our approach outperforms prior works by a large margin in terms of novel view synthesis quality. We also demonstrate the capability of our approach to reconstruct a moving person from a monocular video on the People-Snapshot dataset.
  - [Portrait Neural Radiance Fields from a Single Image](https://portrait-nerf.github.io/) | [code]
    > We present a method for estimating Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) from a single headshot portrait. While NeRF has demonstrated high-quality view synthesis, it requires multiple images of static scenes and thus impractical for casual captures and moving subjects. In this work, we propose to pretrain the weights of a multilayer perceptron (MLP), which implicitly models the volumetric density and colors, with a meta-learning framework using a light stage portrait dataset. To improve the generalization to unseen faces, we train the MLP in the canonical coordinate space approximated by 3D face morphable models. We quantitatively evaluate the method using controlled captures and demonstrate the generalization to real portrait images, showing favorable results against state-of-the-arts.
  - [A-NeRF: Surface-free Human 3D Pose Refinement via Neural Rendering, NeurIPS2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06199) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/LemonATsu/A-NeRF)
    > While deep learning reshaped the classical motion capture pipeline with feed-forward networks, generative models are required to recover fine alignment via iterative refinement. Unfortunately, the existing models are usually hand-crafted or learned in controlled conditions, only applicable to limited domains. We propose a method to learn a generative neural body model from unlabelled monocular videos by extending Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). We equip them with a skeleton to apply to time-varying and articulated motion. A key insight is that implicit models require the inverse of the forward kinematics used in explicit surface models. Our reparameterization defines spatial latent variables relative to the pose of body parts and thereby overcomes ill-posed inverse operations with an overparameterization. This enables learning volumetric body shape and appearance from scratch while jointly refining the articulated pose; all without ground truth labels for appearance, pose, or 3D shape on the input videos. When used for novel-view-synthesis and motion capture, our neural model improves accuracy on diverse datasets. Project website: this https URL .
  - [Learning Compositional Radiance Fields of Dynamic Human Heads, CVPR2021(oral)](https://ziyanw1.github.io/hybrid_nerf/) | [code]
    > Photorealistic rendering of dynamic humans is an important ability for telepresence systems, virtual shopping, synthetic data generation, and more. Recently, neural rendering methods, which combine techniques from computer graphics and machine learning, have created high-fidelity models of humans and objects. Some of these methods do not produce results with high-enough fidelity for driveable human models (Neural Volumes) whereas others have extremely long rendering times (NeRF). We propose a novel compositional 3D representation that combines the best of previous methods to produce both higher-resolution and faster results. Our representation bridges the gap between discrete and continuous volumetric representations by combining a coarse 3D-structure-aware grid of animation codes with a continuous learned scene function that maps every position and its corresponding local animation code to its view-dependent emitted radiance and local volume density. Differentiable volume rendering is employed to compute photo-realistic novel views of the human head and upper body as well as to train our novel representation end-to-end using only 2D supervision. In addition, we show that the learned dynamic radiance field can be used to synthesize novel unseen expressions based on a global animation code. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for synthesizing novel views of dynamic human heads and the upper body.
  - [Editable Free-Viewpoint Video using a Layered Neural Representation, SIGGRAPH2021](https://jiakai-zhang.github.io/st-nerf/) | [***``[code]``***](https://jiakai-zhang.github.io/st-nerf/#code)
    > Generating free-viewpoint videos is critical for immersive VR/AR experience but recent neural advances still lack the editing ability to manipulate the visual perception for large dynamic scenes. To fill this gap, in this paper we propose the first approach for editable photo-realistic free-viewpoint video generation for large-scale dynamic scenes using only sparse 16 cameras. The core of our approach is a new layered neural representation, where each dynamic entity including the environment itself is formulated into a space-time coherent neural layered radiance representation called ST-NeRF. Such layered representation supports fully perception and realistic manipulation of the dynamic scene whilst still supporting a free viewing experience in a wide range. In our ST-NeRF, the dynamic entity/layer is represented as continuous functions, which achieves the disentanglement of location, deformation as well as the appearance of the dynamic entity in a continuous and self-supervised manner. We propose a scene parsing 4D label map tracking to disentangle the spatial information explicitly, and a continuous deform module to disentangle the temporal motion implicitly. An object-aware volume rendering scheme is further introduced for the re-assembling of all the neural layers. We adopt a novel layered loss and motion-aware ray sampling strategy to enable efficient training for a large dynamic scene with multiple performers, Our framework further enables a variety of editing functions, i.e., manipulating the scale and location, duplicating or retiming individual neural layers to create numerous visual effects while preserving high realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to achieve high-quality, photo-realistic, and editable free-viewpoint video generation for dynamic scenes.
