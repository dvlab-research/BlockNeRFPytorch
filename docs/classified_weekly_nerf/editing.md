  - [VolTeMorph: Realtime, Controllable and Generalisable Animation of Volumetric Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.00949) | [***``[code]``***](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.00949)
    > The recent increase in popularity of volumetric representations for scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis has put renewed focus on animating volumetric content at high visual quality and in real-time. While implicit deformation methods based on learned functions can produce impressive results, they are `black boxes' to artists and content creators, they require large amounts of training data to generalise meaningfully, and they do not produce realistic extrapolations outside the training data. In this work we solve these issues by introducing a volume deformation method which is real-time, easy to edit with off-the-shelf software and can extrapolate convincingly. To demonstrate the versatility of our method, we apply it in two scenarios: physics-based object deformation and telepresence where avatars are controlled using blendshapes. We also perform thorough experiments showing that our method compares favourably to both volumetric approaches combined with implicit deformation and methods based on mesh deformation.
  - [Controllable Free Viewpoint Video Reconstruction Based on Neural Radiance Fields and Motion Graphs, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9845414) | [code]
    > In this paper, we propose a controllable high-quality free viewpoint video generation method based on the motion graph and neural radiance fields (NeRF). Different from existing pose-driven NeRF or time/structure conditioned NeRF works, we propose to first construct a directed motion graph of the captured sequence. Such a sequence-motion-parameterization strategy not only enables flexible pose control for free viewpoint video rendering but also avoids redundant calculation of similar poses and thus improves the overall reconstruction efficiency. Moreover, to support body shape control without losing the realistic free viewpoint rendering performance, we improve the vanilla NeRF by combining explicit surface deformation and implicit neural scene representations. Specifically, we train a local surface-guided NeRF for each valid frame on the motion graph, and the volumetric rendering was only performed in the local space around the real surface, thus enabling plausible shape control ability. As far as we know, our method is the first method that supports both realistic free viewpoint video reconstruction and motion graph-based user-guided motion traversal. The results and comparisons further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
  - [Robust Change Detection Based on Neural Descriptor Fields, IROS2022](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9845414) | [code]
    > The ability to reason about changes in the environment is crucial for robots operating over extended periods of time. Agents are expected to capture changes during operation so that actions can be followed to ensure a smooth progression of the working session. However, varying viewing angles and accumulated localization errors make it easy for robots to falsely detect changes in the surrounding world due to low observation overlap and drifted object associations. In this paper, based on the recently proposed category-level Neural Descriptor Fields (NDFs), we develop an object-level online change detection approach that is robust to partially overlapping observations and noisy localization results. Utilizing the shape completion capability and SE(3)-equivariance of NDFs, we represent objects with compact shape codes encoding full object shapes from partial observations. The objects are then organized in a spatial tree structure based on object centers recovered from NDFs for fast queries of object neighborhoods. By associating objects via shape code similarity and comparing local object-neighbor spatial layout, our proposed approach demonstrates robustness to low observation overlap and localization noises. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world sequences and achieve improved change detection results compared to multiple baseline methods. Project webpage:Â this https URL

  - [MobileNeRF: Exploiting the Polygon Rasterization Pipeline for Efficient Neural Field Rendering on Mobile Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00277) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/google-research/jax3d/tree/main/jax3d/projects/mobilenerf)
    > Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated amazing ability to synthesize images of 3D scenes from novel views. However, they rely upon specialized volumetric rendering algorithms based on ray marching that are mismatched to the capabilities of widely deployed graphics hardware. This paper introduces a new NeRF representation based on textured polygons that can synthesize novel images efficiently with standard rendering pipelines. The NeRF is represented as a set of polygons with textures representing binary opacities and feature vectors. Traditional rendering of the polygons with a z-buffer yields an image with features at every pixel, which are interpreted by a small, view-dependent MLP running in a fragment shader to produce a final pixel color. This approach enables NeRFs to be rendered with the traditional polygon rasterization pipeline, which provides massive pixel-level parallelism, achieving interactive frame rates on a wide range of compute platforms, including mobile phones.
  - [Deforming Radiance Fields with Cages, ECCV2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12298) | [code]
    > Recent advances in radiance fields enable photorealistic rendering of static or dynamic 3D scenes, but still do not support explicit deformation that is used for scene manipulation or animation. In this paper, we propose a method that enables a new type of deformation of the radiance field: free-form radiance field deformation. We use a triangular mesh that encloses the foreground object called cage as an interface, and by manipulating the cage vertices, our approach enables the free-form deformation of the radiance field. The core of our approach is cage-based deformation which is commonly used in mesh deformation. We propose a novel formulation to extend it to the radiance field, which maps the position and the view direction of the sampling points from the deformed space to the canonical space, thus enabling the rendering of the deformed scene. The deformation results of the synthetic datasets and the real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
  - [NeuMesh: Learning Disentangled Neural Mesh-based Implicit Field for Geometry and Texture Editing, ECCV2022 (Oral)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11911) | [code]
    > Very recently neural implicit rendering techniques have been rapidly evolved and shown great advantages in novel view synthesis and 3D scene reconstruction. However, existing neural rendering methods for editing purposes offer limited functionality, e.g., rigid transformation, or not applicable for fine-grained editing for general objects from daily lives. In this paper, we present a novel mesh-based representation by encoding the neural implicit field with disentangled geometry and texture codes on mesh vertices, which facilitates a set of editing functionalities, including mesh-guided geometry editing, designated texture editing with texture swapping, filling and painting operations. To this end, we develop several techniques including learnable sign indicators to magnify spatial distinguishability of mesh-based representation, distillation and fine-tuning mechanism to make a steady convergence, and the spatial-aware optimization strategy to realize precise texture editing. Extensive experiments and editing examples on both real and synthetic data demonstrate the superiority of our method on representation quality and editing ability.
